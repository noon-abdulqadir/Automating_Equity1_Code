The research will relate to either public policies or private policies, or both. In the complex and evolving movement towards more sustainable practices and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in the corporate and financial world, both types of policies play important and inter-linked roles.\nIn the field of private policies, we analyse and benchmark responsible credit and investment policies of financial institutions from all over the world, often using the Fair Finance Guide Methodology that we have developed together with the CSOs from 15 countries collaborating in Fair Finance International. This methodology is based on international standards and initiatives on almost all topics relevant for sustainability. We regularly refine and update the methodology, train researchers from Fair Finance Guide countries and review their assessments.\nOther types of private policies we analyse are voluntary certification schemes and procurement policies (such as NDPE policies) in global commodity supply chains, like the forestry, agriculture, mining and fishery sectors. Creating transparency on the criteria included in these policies and assessing them against international standards is crucial to distinguish greenwashing schemes from genuine efforts to push for more sustainability in the corporate world.\n\nThe public policies of various governments which we analyse deal with market regulation, industrial policy and/or innovation in many different economic sectors, ranging from agriculture and other commodity sectors to the food, transport, construction, and financial sectors. Of special interest are public policies emerging in some countries which aim to integrate sustainability criteria (on climate change, biodiversity, or labour rights) in business operations overseas, in supply chains and in financing portfolios.\nWe expect you to:\nhave a university degree in a relevant field of study;\nhave five or more years of research experience in relation to private and/or public policies, preferably related to sustainability in the financial sector;\nbe a versatile and analytically strong researcher who can lead policy-related projects, collaborating with a diverse group of colleagues;\nbe knowledgeable on sustainability-related issues, preferably on climate change and natural resources;\nhave proven experience in writing and editing well-structured reports in English; experience in reading and writing in other major languages is an advantage; and\nlive within commuting distance of our office or have the willingness to relocate.\n\nWe offer:\nthe chance to work on challenging and varied research, advice and training projects with a high social relevance;\nan organisational structure which aims to stimulate your personal and professional development;\ncollaboration within an international team of highly motivated colleagues with diverse fields of expertise;\ndaily contacts with an inspiring civil society network spanning the globe;\nopportunities to further initiate and develop policy-related projects, working together with CSO partners to stimulate social change;\nopportunities to travel abroad for trainings and meetings (COVID-regulations permitting);\na friendly office close to the Amsterdam Sloterdijk train station;\na contract for 32 to 40 hours per week (to be determined in consultation);\nflexible working hours and the option to work part-time from home (but as long as COVID-regulations are in place we work mostly from home);\nan initial monthly salary for 40 hours per week between \u20ac 3,491 and \u20ac 4,402, depending on years of experience; and\na good pension scheme and other fringe benefits.\n\nProfundo is an equal opportunity employer striving for a diverse and inclusive workplace.
