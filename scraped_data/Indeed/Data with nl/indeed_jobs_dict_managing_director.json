With a promising unique technology based on optical fiber sensing, a first product was built in 2012: an extremely sensitive measurement device that could break new ground in the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. After this product, many more unique sensing products were developed and put in the market. The company now has two business units serving different markets with different products: Optics11 Life and Optics11 Industrial Sensing. Over the last years the company has grown rapidly and employs over 50 professionals, with an installed base of successful products all over the world.The company is entering into a new growth phase.The two business units will grow more independently, and accelerate the roll-out of the product roadmap.Market Opportunity:Optics11 Life is addressing a large market opportunity. Medical treatment is going through a multi-faceted revolution. Drug development is seeing a paradigm shift towards 3D cell culture and Organ-On-a-Chip (OOC), thereby drastically reducing development cost, failure rates and time to market of vital treatments. Regenerative medicine, which aims to replace damaged tissue in patients based with stem cell based engineered tissue, will provide a cure for previously untreatable conditions, and contribute to a solution for shortage of organs for transplantation.These fields are now developing at a high pace, starting in academia and in R&D and moving towards near-future industrial value chains. This will revolutionize medical treatment in many ways. These changes require new instrumentation, both to drive progress, to validate the achievements and to monitor and control the future industrial processes.One of the driving forces behind both the revolution in regenerative medicine as well as Organ-On-a-Chip, is a deepened understanding of the role of mechanics and forces in physiology and disease. From stem cells to organoids, from hydrogels to engineered tissues, it is becoming increasingly clear that the mechano-biological state is of major importance to the biological processes. Being able to characterize, monitor and control the mechano-biological state is going to be a key element in the emerging chains.Optics11 Life is at the leading edge of these emerging industries, and is extremely well equipped to be able to provide the key instrumentation that these new industrial chains will need.Job purpose: Within the first year of employment, the MD will get the opportunity to grow into the role of being fully responsible for the total Operations of Optics11 Life.
