Eukaryotic cells possess an intricate ubiquitin protein \u2018labelling\u2019 system to regulate these changes. The aim of this project is to reveal the dynamics of this system at the single-molecule level for the first time. You will use advanced optical tweezers with combined single-molecule fluorescence and novel biochemical approaches to directly measure the striking hypothesized motor-like movements, complex interplay between protein chain folding, unfolding, and translocation, and to elucidate the mysterious role of the branched protein chain topology of these substrates. These experiments will provide unprecedented dynamic insights at the nanoscale level of this remarkable protein processing system.\n\nThis project has now become possible owing to recent technical advances, including the new in vitro assays of our collaborators, novel structural approaches, and optical tweezers techniques pioneered by our lab. The latter have previously shown how chaperones extend, clamp, confine, and processively pull on protein chains (Science 2007, Nature 2013, Nature 2016, Nature 2020). You will develop novel single-molecule approaches, automated data analysis methods, and help define innovative molecular biology methods, in order to enable this first dynamic view on ubiquitin-mediated protein chain processing.\n\nElucidating how this system works dynamically is of tremendous importance, given its central operation throughout the cell, for instance in regulating chromatin remodelers, key cell-cycle complexes, cytoskeletal organization, and more generally in maintaining the balance of protein error and repair, and is therefore also implicated in a wide spectrum of medical conditions. This project thus provides the opportunity to bridge the gap between single molecule events and crucial cellular function and malfunction.\nAbout the group\nSandertanslab and Biophysics\nQualifications\nWe are looking for an outstanding experimental physicist or chemist with an interest in single-molecule techniques, programming skills to handle complex data, and a strong drive to excel in a competitive international environment.

Eukaryotic cells possess an intricate ubiquitin protein \u2018labelling\u2019 system to regulate these changes. The aim of this project is to reveal the dynamics of this system at the single-molecule level for the first time. You will use advanced optical tweezers with combined single-molecule fluorescence and novel biochemical approaches to directly measure the striking hypothesized motor-like movements, complex interplay between protein chain folding, unfolding, and translocation, and to elucidate the mysterious role of the branched protein chain topology of these substrates. These experiments will provide unprecedented dynamic insights at the nanoscale level of this remarkable protein processing system.\n\nThis project has now become possible owing to recent technical advances, including the new in vitro assays of our collaborators, novel structural approaches, and optical tweezers techniques pioneered by our lab. The latter have previously shown how chaperones extend, clamp, confine, and processively pull on protein chains (Science 2007, Nature 2013, Nature 2016, Nature 2020). You will develop novel single-molecule approaches, automated data analysis methods, and help define innovative molecular biology methods, in order to enable this first dynamic view on ubiquitin-mediated protein chain processing.\n\nElucidating how this system works dynamically is of tremendous importance, given its central operation throughout the cell, for instance in regulating chromatin remodelers, key cell-cycle complexes, cytoskeletal organization, and more generally in maintaining the balance of protein error and repair, and is therefore also implicated in a wide spectrum of medical conditions. This project thus provides the opportunity to bridge the gap between single molecule events and crucial cellular function and malfunction.\nAbout the group\nSandertanslab and Biophysics\nQualifications\nWe are looking for an outstanding experimental physicist or chemist with an interest in single-molecule techniques, programming skills to handle complex data, and a strong drive to excel in a competitive international environment.

But how reliably can a cell make such predictions, which are the mechanisms that implement them, and what are their fitness benefits?\n\nIn this project, you will address these questions experimentally, using single-cell microscopy to precisely quantify (in bits) the amount of predictive information cells extract from past experiences. The primary experimental vehicle will be a single-cell FRET method developed in our group (Keegstra et al., 2017 eLife; Kamino et al., 2020, Science Advances). Your measurements will quantify information transmission and prediction in the E. coli chemotaxis system \u2013 a cell signaling network for which sufficient quantitative knowledge exists to address further questions about mechanistic origins and functional benefits of prediction. You will collaborate closely with the theory group of Pieter Rein ten Wolde (AMOLF), using concepts from information theory and stochastic thermodynamics to design and interpret experiments.\n\nFor further information on the project, contact Tom Shimizu (shimizu@amolf.nl).\nAbout the group\nFor more information about research in the Shimizu Group, see https://amolf.nl/research-groups/systems-biology.\nQualifications\nYou need to meet the requirements for a doctors-degree and must have research experience in a non-Dutch academic environment.\n\nWe seek candidates with a strong background in experimental physics or quantitative biology and an interest in the biophysics of cellular information processing. Prior experience with microscopy is preferred.\nTerms of employment\nThe position is intended as full-time (40 hours / week, 12 months / year) appointment in the service of the Netherlands Foundation of Scientific Research Institutes (NWO-I) for the duration of two years.

Eukaryotic cells possess an intricate ubiquitin protein \u2018labelling\u2019 system to regulate these changes. The aim of this project is to reveal the dynamics of this system at the single-molecule level for the first time. You will use advanced optical tweezers with combined single-molecule fluorescence and novel biochemical approaches to directly measure the striking hypothesized motor-like movements, complex interplay between protein chain folding, unfolding, and translocation, and to elucidate the mysterious role of the branched protein chain topology of these substrates. These experiments will provide unprecedented dynamic insights at the nanoscale level of this remarkable protein processing system.\n\nThis project has now become possible owing to recent technical advances, including the new in vitro assays of our collaborators, novel structural approaches, and optical tweezers techniques pioneered by our lab. The latter have previously shown how chaperones extend, clamp, confine, and processively pull on protein chains (Science 2007, Nature 2013, Nature 2016, Nature 2020). You will develop novel single-molecule approaches, automated data analysis methods, and help define innovative molecular biology methods, in order to enable this first dynamic view on ubiquitin-mediated protein chain processing.\n\nElucidating how this system works dynamically is of tremendous importance, given its central operation throughout the cell, for instance in regulating chromatin remodelers, key cell-cycle complexes, cytoskeletal organization, and more generally in maintaining the balance of protein error and repair, and is therefore also implicated in a wide spectrum of medical conditions. This project thus provides the opportunity to bridge the gap between single molecule events and crucial cellular function and malfunction.\nAbout the group\nSandertanslab and Biophysics\nQualifications\nWe are looking for an outstanding experimental physicist or chemist with an interest in single-molecule techniques, programming skills to handle complex data, and a strong drive to excel in a competitive international environment.
