The internships or graduation project will allow you to learn how data science technology is applied in commercial and government organizations for mission critical applications and at the same time execute thorough scientific research.\n\nThe next internship/graduation project is available:\n\nProblem\n\nIn criminal and fraud investigation, large collections of emails, social media or other forms of communication are analyzed. Often such collections consist of Tb\u2019s of unstructured information. Search is no longer good enough to find the needle in the haystack. With 30 years\u2019 experience in fraud and criminal investigations, ZyLAB has noticed that when something goes wrong in a criminal scheme, relevant communication often contains high levels of emotions, communication or cursing. Detecting such patterns is a complex task. Keyword search is generating too much noise and it is hard to capture the right linguistic context using traditional search techniques. Initial experiments using machine learning and annotated data sets has shown to be performing at par with human performance for such tasks. In this project, we would like to develop machine-learning based methods to recognize emotions, sentiments, cursing, or cynicism in various languages.\n\nKey challenges\n\nThe key challenges in this project are the ability to deal with new types emotions, sentiments, cursing or cynicism (e.g. names that are unique and that the system has never seen before) and dealing with negations, subjectivity or ambiguity of emotions, sentiments, cursing or cynicism.\n\nThe system has to use annotated data sets in various languages to learn how to identify and extract such patterns. The system needs to approximate human performance (70-80% precision and recall).\n\nResearch Questions\n\nWhat are the best machine learning algorithms to teach a system to recognize and extract emotions, sentiments, cursing or cynicism.\nWhat are the best features to use for the machine learning.\nHow good is the performance of such systems (in terms of precision, recall and F1-values).\nWhat relations can be taught and how does the performance between different types of relations vary?\nWhat post and preprocessing methods can be used to increase the performance of the system?\n\nOther Expected / Desired Outcomes\n\nAt ZyLAB R&D, first a prototype is developed using a very basic approach to set a base line performance. Next, the objective is to use novel methods such as advanced machine learning methods (deep learning, better feature factories, better document representation methods, etc.) to create a better performing system.\n\nData Sets\n\nZyLAB has several data sets to train and validate the performance of such systems.More information on other projects can be found here: https://textminingum.wordpress.com/\n\nCompensation\n\nDepending on your programming skills, ZyLAB will pay you an internship fee which is significant higher than what most other companies would pay you.

ZyLAB applies its specialization in many ways: by searching in big batches of data with requests under the Public Access Act, by finding key information in large datasets in the context of competition law, making information 'GDPR-proof' et cetera.\n\nMany law students of the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences have already conducted their third-year internships and fourth-year graduation research at ZyLAB. Due to the success of these internships, ZyLAB is looking for new students for 3rd year internships and 4th year graduation projects.\n\nFor who\n\nThis internship is best for International Law students (University of Applied Science) who:\n\nhave a good understanding of the legal aspects of for instance handling public records requests (\u201cWet Openbaarheid Bestuur\u201d or WOB), the answering of regulatory requests or fulfilling subject access requests, and\nare interested in applying legal technology to increase the quality and efficiency of such processes.\n\nLocation\n\nThe internship is at the office in Amsterdam.\n\nProblem\n\nLegalTech is more popular than ever. However, the large-scale adaptation of LegalTech is slowed down by a number of factors:\n\nUser adaptation (or the lack of ease of use),\nTranslating steps in the legal process into technology steps,\nLegal defensibility and transparency of such technology,\nEmbedding technology in legal operations.\n\nMany LegalTech applications use typical IT, AI and Data Science jargon, which is not understood by legal professionals. On the other hand, law books and case law use their own jargon, which is not understood by IT professionals and data scientists.\n\nIn order to bring these two worlds more together, this internship focusses on mapping the specific legal requirements of large information requests to the ZyLAB ONE eDiscovery software. Especially for business cases such as litigation, arbitration, subject access requests (GDPR), public records requests (verzoeken Wet Openbaarheid Bestuur \u2013 Wob), internal investigations, etc.\n\nIn addition, these internships should also document legal requirements needed to use technology for such processes and safeguard issues as privacy, security, and data protection at the same time.\n\nKey challenges\n\nThe key challenges in this project are the mapping of legal terminology and requirements to that of the LegalTech world, AI and Data Science in particular. This requires a thorough understanding of all legal aspects of a certain application, as well as the ZyLAB ONE software, including its artificial intelligence and data science based machine learning and text-mining algorithms.\n\nResearch Questions\n\nFor a particular legal process, what are the specific requirement from a legal point of view when LegalTech is applied?\nHow can these requirements be embedded in the LegalTech process?\nHow can the requirements be audited and validated?\nHow can best practices best be document in a document, which is understood and accepted by both legal and IT professionals?\n\nOther Expected / Desired Outcomes\n\nThe desired outcome is a well-documented best-practice guideline for the use of ZyLAB ONE software on a specific legal process.\n\nContact\n\nIf you are interested, please contact us at hrm@zylab.com, or reach out to us via our social media channels.", "Rating": -1.0, "Employment Type": "-1", "Company URL": "https://indeed.nl/rc/clk?jk=541b6b0bb2f2ccc5&from=vj&mvj=0&vjfrom=vjs&pos=bottom&astse=91bb0a76c248879c&assa=7619", "Job URL": "https://nl.indeed.com/vacature-bekijken?jk=541b6b0bb2f2ccc5&fccid=cef8d5469db38990&vjs=3", "Job Age": "14 dagen geleden", "Job Age Number": "14 dagen geleden", "Collection Date": "2021-01-22"}, {"Search Keyword": "mining", "Platform": "Indeed", "Job ID": "p_54f215adebccfc0b", "Job Title": "Communications Business Partner", "Company Name": "AkzoNobel", "Location": " Amsterdam", "Job Description": "Date: Jan 12, 2021\nLocation: Amsterdam, NL\nCompany: AkzoNobel\nAkzoNobel has a passion for paint.

The meta information may not be complete or can be inconsistent. The van Gogh museum is interested in applying advanced artificial intelligence, data science and data visualization techniques to verify the quality of the meta information, to identify anomalies and to organize and clean up the archives. In addition, the museum is interested in integrating the content of the textual documents with other sources or information which resides in other content management systems. Finally, the museum wishes to understand how advanced information extraction techniques can provide new insights in the history of and relations between individuals, locations, organization and works of art of van Gogh and others.\n\nAll this requires a thorough understanding of the ZyLAB ONE software, but also of modern artificial intelligence, data science, text-mining, artificial intelligence and data visualization techniques algorithms.\n\nKey challenges\n\nThe key challenges in this project are that text from some of the material is based on low quality document scans, these have resulted in a lower quality text generated by using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools. In addition, the documents are highly unstructured and very different in format.\n\nIn addition, individual names (especially those transliterated from non-Roman spellings) have resulted in many different spelling variations, as have historical spelling variations.\n\nThe information extraction and machine learning methods used therefor have to be robust against such OCR errors, misspellings, transliteration and historical spelling variations.\n\nResearch Questions\n\nThe research questions in this research are:\n\nHow and which information extraction and data visualization methods be used to analyze the completeness and consistency of the information and meta data\nWhich information extraction and machine learning methods are useful to provide additional insights into the content of the documentation of the van Gogh Museum.\nHow can such methods be made robust against OCR errors, but also against misspellings, transliteration and spelling variations.\nHow can the quality (quantitative and qualitative) of these methods be measured.\nWhat is the quality of the results of these methods.\n\nOther Expected / Desired Outcomes\n\nThe methods used have to interact with all the information (including all metadata) in the ZyLAB platform via the ZyLAB API\u2019s, now and in the future.\n\nMore Information\n\nMore information on R&D projects which ultimately find their application in the ZyLAB ONE platform can be found here: https://textmining.nu\n\nContact\n\nIf you are interested, please contact us at hrm@zylab.com, or leave your details on this page.", "Rating": -1.0, "Employment Type": "-1", "Company URL": "https://indeed.nl/rc/clk?jk=8e80491e2209532a&from=vj&mvj=0&vjfrom=vjs&pos=bottom&astse=4a9188bef8453e70&assa=4691", "Job URL": "https://nl.indeed.com/vacature-bekijken?jk=8e80491e2209532a&fccid=cef8d5469db38990&vjs=3", "Job Age": "14 dagen geleden", "Job Age Number": "14 dagen geleden", "Collection Date": "2021-01-22"}, {"Search Keyword": "mining", "Platform": "Indeed", "Job ID": "p_c5b060d74728e0c0", "Job Title": "Quantitative Analysts", "Company Name": "Trefi", "Location": " Amsterdam", "Job Description": "We know that you have a strong analytical (academic) background and that you love data mining.\n\nOf course you have been programming in Java, or is C++ your language?\n\n\nGuess what, your skills can change the world.\n\n\nIn our case the world of finance.\n\nNot only will you design, develop, implement and calibrate new models but actually have impact!\n\nTo tell you a little bit about our company:\n\nWhat we do effects the life of business owners all over the world.

The internships or graduation project will allow you to learn how data science technology is applied in commercial and government organizations for mission critical applications and at the same time execute thorough scientific research.\n\nThe next internship/graduation project is available:\n\nProblem\n\nIn criminal and fraud investigation, large collections of emails, social media or other forms of communication are analyzed. Often such collections consist of Tb\u2019s of unstructured information. Search is no longer good enough to find the needle in the haystack. With 30 years\u2019 experience in fraud and criminal investigations, ZyLAB has noticed that when something goes wrong in a criminal scheme, relevant communication often contains high levels of emotions, communication or cursing. Detecting such patterns is a complex task. Keyword search is generating too much noise and it is hard to capture the right linguistic context using traditional search techniques. Initial experiments using machine learning and annotated data sets has shown to be performing at par with human performance for such tasks. In this project, we would like to develop machine-learning based methods to recognize emotions, sentiments, cursing, or cynicism in various languages.\n\nKey challenges\n\nThe key challenges in this project are the ability to deal with new types emotions, sentiments, cursing or cynicism (e.g. names that are unique and that the system has never seen before) and dealing with negations, subjectivity or ambiguity of emotions, sentiments, cursing or cynicism.\n\nThe system has to use annotated data sets in various languages to learn how to identify and extract such patterns. The system needs to approximate human performance (70-80% precision and recall).\n\nResearch Questions\n\nWhat are the best machine learning algorithms to teach a system to recognize and extract emotions, sentiments, cursing or cynicism.\nWhat are the best features to use for the machine learning.\nHow good is the performance of such systems (in terms of precision, recall and F1-values).\nWhat relations can be taught and how does the performance between different types of relations vary?\nWhat post and preprocessing methods can be used to increase the performance of the system?\n\nOther Expected / Desired Outcomes\n\nAt ZyLAB R&D, first a prototype is developed using a very basic approach to set a base line performance. Next, the objective is to use novel methods such as advanced machine learning methods (deep learning, better feature factories, better document representation methods, etc.) to create a better performing system.\n\nData Sets\n\nZyLAB has several data sets to train and validate the performance of such systems.More information on other projects can be found here: https://textminingum.wordpress.com/\n\nCompensation\n\nDepending on your programming skills, ZyLAB will pay you an internship fee which is significant higher than what most other companies would pay you.

ZyLAB applies its specialization in many ways: by searching in big batches of data with requests under the Public Access Act, by finding key information in large datasets in the context of competition law, making information 'GDPR-proof' et cetera.\n\nMany law students of the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences have already conducted their third-year internships and fourth-year graduation research at ZyLAB.

However, the large-scale adaptation of LegalTech is slowed down by a number of factors:\n\nUser adaptation (or the lack of ease of use),\nTranslating steps in the legal process into technology steps,\nLegal defensibility and transparency of such technology,\nEmbedding technology in legal operations.\n\nMany LegalTech applications use typical IT, AI and Data Science jargon, which is not understood by legal professionals. On the other hand, law books and case law use their own jargon, which is not understood by IT professionals and data scientists.\n\nIn order to bring these two worlds more together, this internship focusses on mapping the specific legal requirements of large information requests to the ZyLAB ONE eDiscovery software. Especially for business cases such as litigation, arbitration, subject access requests (GDPR), public records requests (verzoeken Wet Openbaarheid Bestuur \u2013 Wob), internal investigations, etc.\n\nIn addition, these internships should also document legal requirements needed to use technology for such processes and safeguard issues as privacy, security, and data protection at the same time.\n\nKey challenges\n\nThe key challenges in this project are the mapping of legal terminology and requirements to that of the LegalTech world, AI and Data Science in particular. This requires a thorough understanding of all legal aspects of a certain application, as well as the ZyLAB ONE software, including its artificial intelligence and data science based machine learning and text-mining algorithms.\n\nResearch Questions\n\nFor a particular legal process, what are the specific requirement from a legal point of view when LegalTech is applied?\nHow can these requirements be embedded in the LegalTech process?\nHow can the requirements be audited and validated?\nHow can best practices best be document in a document, which is understood and accepted by both legal and IT professionals?\n\nOther Expected / Desired Outcomes\n\nThe desired outcome is a well-documented best-practice guideline for the use of ZyLAB ONE software on a specific legal process.\n\nContact\n\nIf you are interested, please contact us at hrm@zylab.com, or reach out to us via our social media channels.", "Rating": -1.0, "Employment Type": -1, "Company URL": "https://indeed.nl/rc/clk?jk=541b6b0bb2f2ccc5&from=vj&mvj=0&vjfrom=vjs&pos=bottom&astse=91bb0a76c248879c&assa=7619", "Job URL": "https://nl.indeed.com/vacature-bekijken?jk=541b6b0bb2f2ccc5&fccid=cef8d5469db38990&vjs=3", "Job Age": "14 dagen geleden", "Job Age Number": "14 dagen geleden", "Collection Date": "2021-01-22", "Language": "en"}, {"index": 4, "Search Keyword": "mining", "Platform": "Indeed", "Job ID": "p_54f215adebccfc0b", "Job Title": "Communications Business Partner", "Company Name": "AkzoNobel", "Location": " Amsterdam", "Job Description": "Date: Jan 12, 2021\nLocation: Amsterdam, NL\nCompany: AkzoNobel\nAkzoNobel has a passion for paint.

In addition, the museum is interested in integrating the content of the textual documents with other sources or information which resides in other content management systems. Finally, the museum wishes to understand how advanced information extraction techniques can provide new insights in the history of and relations between individuals, locations, organization and works of art of van Gogh and others.\n\nAll this requires a thorough understanding of the ZyLAB ONE software, but also of modern artificial intelligence, data science, text-mining, artificial intelligence and data visualization techniques algorithms.\n\nKey challenges\n\nThe key challenges in this project are that text from some of the material is based on low quality document scans, these have resulted in a lower quality text generated by using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools. In addition, the documents are highly unstructured and very different in format.\n\nIn addition, individual names (especially those transliterated from non-Roman spellings) have resulted in many different spelling variations, as have historical spelling variations.\n\nThe information extraction and machine learning methods used therefor have to be robust against such OCR errors, misspellings, transliteration and historical spelling variations.\n\nResearch Questions\n\nThe research questions in this research are:\n\nHow and which information extraction and data visualization methods be used to analyze the completeness and consistency of the information and meta data\nWhich information extraction and machine learning methods are useful to provide additional insights into the content of the documentation of the van Gogh Museum.\nHow can such methods be made robust against OCR errors, but also against misspellings, transliteration and spelling variations.\nHow can the quality (quantitative and qualitative) of these methods be measured.\nWhat is the quality of the results of these methods.\n\nOther Expected / Desired Outcomes\n\nThe methods used have to interact with all the information (including all metadata) in the ZyLAB platform via the ZyLAB API\u2019s, now and in the future.\n\nMore Information\n\nMore information on R&D projects which ultimately find their application in the ZyLAB ONE platform can be found here: https://textmining.nu\n\nContact\n\nIf you are interested, please contact us at hrm@zylab.com, or leave your details on this page.", "Rating": -1.0, "Employment Type": -1, "Company URL": "https://indeed.nl/rc/clk?jk=8e80491e2209532a&from=vj&mvj=0&vjfrom=vjs&pos=bottom&astse=4a9188bef8453e70&assa=4691", "Job URL": "https://nl.indeed.com/vacature-bekijken?jk=8e80491e2209532a&fccid=cef8d5469db38990&vjs=3", "Job Age": "14 dagen geleden", "Job Age Number": "14 dagen geleden", "Collection Date": "2021-01-22", "Language": "en"}, {"index": 11, "Search Keyword": "mining", "Platform": "Indeed", "Job ID": "p_c5b060d74728e0c0", "Job Title": "Quantitative Analysts", "Company Name": "Trefi", "Location": " Amsterdam", "Job Description": "We know that you have a strong analytical (academic) background and that you love data mining.\n\nOf course you have been programming in Java, or is C++ your language?\n\n\nGuess what, your skills can change the world.\n\n\nIn our case the world of finance.\n\nNot only will you design, develop, implement and calibrate new models but actually have impact!\n\nTo tell you a little bit about our company:\n\nWhat we do effects the life of business owners all over the world.

The internships or graduation project will allow you to learn how data science technology is applied in commercial and government organizations for mission critical applications and at the same time execute thorough scientific research.\n\nThe next internship/graduation project is available:\n\nProblem\n\nIn criminal and fraud investigation, large collections of emails, social media or other forms of communication are analyzed. Often such collections consist of Tb\u2019s of unstructured information. Search is no longer good enough to find the needle in the haystack. With 30 years\u2019 experience in fraud and criminal investigations, ZyLAB has noticed that when something goes wrong in a criminal scheme, relevant communication often contains high levels of emotions, communication or cursing. Detecting such patterns is a complex task. Keyword search is generating too much noise and it is hard to capture the right linguistic context using traditional search techniques. Initial experiments using machine learning and annotated data sets has shown to be performing at par with human performance for such tasks. In this project, we would like to develop machine-learning based methods to recognize emotions, sentiments, cursing, or cynicism in various languages.\n\nKey challenges\n\nThe key challenges in this project are the ability to deal with new types emotions, sentiments, cursing or cynicism (e.g. names that are unique and that the system has never seen before) and dealing with negations, subjectivity or ambiguity of emotions, sentiments, cursing or cynicism.\n\nThe system has to use annotated data sets in various languages to learn how to identify and extract such patterns. The system needs to approximate human performance (70-80% precision and recall).\n\nResearch Questions\n\nWhat are the best machine learning algorithms to teach a system to recognize and extract emotions, sentiments, cursing or cynicism.\nWhat are the best features to use for the machine learning.\nHow good is the performance of such systems (in terms of precision, recall and F1-values).\nWhat relations can be taught and how does the performance between different types of relations vary?\nWhat post and preprocessing methods can be used to increase the performance of the system?\n\nOther Expected / Desired Outcomes\n\nAt ZyLAB R&D, first a prototype is developed using a very basic approach to set a base line performance. Next, the objective is to use novel methods such as advanced machine learning methods (deep learning, better feature factories, better document representation methods, etc.) to create a better performing system.\n\nData Sets\n\nZyLAB has several data sets to train and validate the performance of such systems.More information on other projects can be found here: https://textminingum.wordpress.com/\n\nCompensation\n\nDepending on your programming skills, ZyLAB will pay you an internship fee which is significant higher than what most other companies would pay you.

ZyLAB applies its specialization in many ways: by searching in big batches of data with requests under the Public Access Act, by finding key information in large datasets in the context of competition law, making information 'GDPR-proof' et cetera.\n\nMany law students of the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences have already conducted their third-year internships and fourth-year graduation research at ZyLAB. Due to the success of these internships, ZyLAB is looking for new students for 3rd year internships and 4th year graduation projects.\n\nFor who\n\nThis internship is best for International Law students (University of Applied Science) who:\n\nhave a good understanding of the legal aspects of for instance handling public records requests (\u201cWet Openbaarheid Bestuur\u201d or WOB), the answering of regulatory requests or fulfilling subject access requests, and\nare interested in applying legal technology to increase the quality and efficiency of such processes.\n\nLocation\n\nThe internship is at the office in Amsterdam.\n\nProblem\n\nLegalTech is more popular than ever. However, the large-scale adaptation of LegalTech is slowed down by a number of factors:\n\nUser adaptation (or the lack of ease of use),\nTranslating steps in the legal process into technology steps,\nLegal defensibility and transparency of such technology,\nEmbedding technology in legal operations.\n\nMany LegalTech applications use typical IT, AI and Data Science jargon, which is not understood by legal professionals. On the other hand, law books and case law use their own jargon, which is not understood by IT professionals and data scientists.\n\nIn order to bring these two worlds more together, this internship focusses on mapping the specific legal requirements of large information requests to the ZyLAB ONE eDiscovery software. Especially for business cases such as litigation, arbitration, subject access requests (GDPR), public records requests (verzoeken Wet Openbaarheid Bestuur \u2013 Wob), internal investigations, etc.\n\nIn addition, these internships should also document legal requirements needed to use technology for such processes and safeguard issues as privacy, security, and data protection at the same time.\n\nKey challenges\n\nThe key challenges in this project are the mapping of legal terminology and requirements to that of the LegalTech world, AI and Data Science in particular. This requires a thorough understanding of all legal aspects of a certain application, as well as the ZyLAB ONE software, including its artificial intelligence and data science based machine learning and text-mining algorithms.\n\nResearch Questions\n\nFor a particular legal process, what are the specific requirement from a legal point of view when LegalTech is applied?\nHow can these requirements be embedded in the LegalTech process?\nHow can the requirements be audited and validated?\nHow can best practices best be document in a document, which is understood and accepted by both legal and IT professionals?\n\nOther Expected / Desired Outcomes\n\nThe desired outcome is a well-documented best-practice guideline for the use of ZyLAB ONE software on a specific legal process.\n\nContact\n\nIf you are interested, please contact us at hrm@zylab.com, or reach out to us via our social media channels.", "Rating": -1.0, "Employment Type": -1, "Company URL": "https://indeed.nl/rc/clk?jk=541b6b0bb2f2ccc5&from=vj&mvj=0&vjfrom=vjs&pos=bottom&astse=91bb0a76c248879c&assa=7619", "Job URL": "https://nl.indeed.com/vacature-bekijken?jk=541b6b0bb2f2ccc5&fccid=cef8d5469db38990&vjs=3", "Job Age": "14 dagen geleden", "Job Age Number": "14 dagen geleden", "Collection Date": "2021-01-22", "Language": "en", "Gender": "Neutral"}, {"index": 4, "Search Keyword": "mining", "Platform": "Indeed", "Job ID": "p_54f215adebccfc0b", "Job Title": "Communications Business Partner", "Company Name": "AkzoNobel", "Location": " Amsterdam", "Job Description": "Date: Jan 12, 2021\nLocation: Amsterdam, NL\nCompany: AkzoNobel\nAkzoNobel has a passion for paint.

In addition, the documents are highly unstructured and very different in format.\n\nIn addition, individual names (especially those transliterated from non-Roman spellings) have resulted in many different spelling variations, as have historical spelling variations.\n\nThe information extraction and machine learning methods used therefor have to be robust against such OCR errors, misspellings, transliteration and historical spelling variations.\n\nResearch Questions\n\nThe research questions in this research are:\n\nHow and which information extraction and data visualization methods be used to analyze the completeness and consistency of the information and meta data\nWhich information extraction and machine learning methods are useful to provide additional insights into the content of the documentation of the van Gogh Museum.\nHow can such methods be made robust against OCR errors, but also against misspellings, transliteration and spelling variations.\nHow can the quality (quantitative and qualitative) of these methods be measured.\nWhat is the quality of the results of these methods.\n\nOther Expected / Desired Outcomes\n\nThe methods used have to interact with all the information (including all metadata) in the ZyLAB platform via the ZyLAB API\u2019s, now and in the future.\n\nMore Information\n\nMore information on R&D projects which ultimately find their application in the ZyLAB ONE platform can be found here: https://textmining.nu\n\nContact\n\nIf you are interested, please contact us at hrm@zylab.com, or leave your details on this page.", "Rating": -1.0, "Employment Type": -1, "Company URL": "https://indeed.nl/rc/clk?jk=8e80491e2209532a&from=vj&mvj=0&vjfrom=vjs&pos=bottom&astse=4a9188bef8453e70&assa=4691", "Job URL": "https://nl.indeed.com/vacature-bekijken?jk=8e80491e2209532a&fccid=cef8d5469db38990&vjs=3", "Job Age": "14 dagen geleden", "Job Age Number": "14 dagen geleden", "Collection Date": "2021-01-22", "Language": "en", "Gender": "Neutral"}, {"index": 11, "Search Keyword": "mining", "Platform": "Indeed", "Job ID": "p_c5b060d74728e0c0", "Job Title": "Quantitative Analysts", "Company Name": "Trefi", "Location": " Amsterdam", "Job Description": "We know that you have a strong analytical (academic) background and that you love data mining.\n\nOf course you have been programming in Java, or is C++ your language?\n\n\nGuess what, your skills can change the world.\n\n\nIn our case the world of finance.\n\nNot only will you design, develop, implement and calibrate new models but actually have impact!\n\nTo tell you a little bit about our company:\n\nWhat we do effects the life of business owners all over the world.

The internships or graduation project will allow you to learn how data science technology is applied in commercial and government organizations for mission critical applications and at the same time execute thorough scientific research.\n\nThe next internship/graduation project is available:\n\nProblem\n\nIn criminal and fraud investigation, large collections of emails, social media or other forms of communication are analyzed. Often such collections consist of Tb\u2019s of unstructured information. Search is no longer good enough to find the needle in the haystack. With 30 years\u2019 experience in fraud and criminal investigations, ZyLAB has noticed that when something goes wrong in a criminal scheme, relevant communication often contains high levels of emotions, communication or cursing. Detecting such patterns is a complex task. Keyword search is generating too much noise and it is hard to capture the right linguistic context using traditional search techniques. Initial experiments using machine learning and annotated data sets has shown to be performing at par with human performance for such tasks. In this project, we would like to develop machine-learning based methods to recognize emotions, sentiments, cursing, or cynicism in various languages.\n\nKey challenges\n\nThe key challenges in this project are the ability to deal with new types emotions, sentiments, cursing or cynicism (e.g. names that are unique and that the system has never seen before) and dealing with negations, subjectivity or ambiguity of emotions, sentiments, cursing or cynicism.\n\nThe system has to use annotated data sets in various languages to learn how to identify and extract such patterns. The system needs to approximate human performance (70-80% precision and recall).\n\nResearch Questions\n\nWhat are the best machine learning algorithms to teach a system to recognize and extract emotions, sentiments, cursing or cynicism.\nWhat are the best features to use for the machine learning.\nHow good is the performance of such systems (in terms of precision, recall and F1-values).\nWhat relations can be taught and how does the performance between different types of relations vary?\nWhat post and preprocessing methods can be used to increase the performance of the system?\n\nOther Expected / Desired Outcomes\n\nAt ZyLAB R&D, first a prototype is developed using a very basic approach to set a base line performance. Next, the objective is to use novel methods such as advanced machine learning methods (deep learning, better feature factories, better document representation methods, etc.) to create a better performing system.\n\nData Sets\n\nZyLAB has several data sets to train and validate the performance of such systems.More information on other projects can be found here: https://textminingum.wordpress.com/\n\nCompensation\n\nDepending on your programming skills, ZyLAB will pay you an internship fee which is significant higher than what most other companies would pay you.

ZyLAB applies its specialization in many ways: by searching in big batches of data with requests under the Public Access Act, by finding key information in large datasets in the context of competition law, making information 'GDPR-proof' et cetera.\n\nMany law students of the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences have already conducted their third-year internships and fourth-year graduation research at ZyLAB. Due to the success of these internships, ZyLAB is looking for new students for 3rd year internships and 4th year graduation projects.\n\nFor who\n\nThis internship is best for International Law students (University of Applied Science) who:\n\nhave a good understanding of the legal aspects of for instance handling public records requests (\u201cWet Openbaarheid Bestuur\u201d or WOB), the answering of regulatory requests or fulfilling subject access requests, and\nare interested in applying legal technology to increase the quality and efficiency of such processes.\n\nLocation\n\nThe internship is at the office in Amsterdam.\n\nProblem\n\nLegalTech is more popular than ever. However, the large-scale adaptation of LegalTech is slowed down by a number of factors:\n\nUser adaptation (or the lack of ease of use),\nTranslating steps in the legal process into technology steps,\nLegal defensibility and transparency of such technology,\nEmbedding technology in legal operations.\n\nMany LegalTech applications use typical IT, AI and Data Science jargon, which is not understood by legal professionals.

This includes but is not limited to: background information on van Gogh paintings and drawings, documentation of special exhibitions, correspondence, personal collections from van Gogh specialists, newspaper clippings about the van Gogh museum and van Gogh\u2019s work, etc.\n\nFor who\n\nThis internship is best for computer science students looking for an internship or MSc graduation project in the fields of text-mining, information retrieval, artificial intelligence, data science or machine learning.\n\nLocation\n\nThe internship location is the Van Gogh Museum in the center of Amsterdam.\n\nProblem\n\nThis particular document collection consists of scanned documents and corresponding meta-information. The meta information may not be complete or can be inconsistent. The van Gogh museum is interested in applying advanced artificial intelligence, data science and data visualization techniques to verify the quality of the meta information, to identify anomalies and to organize and clean up the archives. In addition, the museum is interested in integrating the content of the textual documents with other sources or information which resides in other content management systems. Finally, the museum wishes to understand how advanced information extraction techniques can provide new insights in the history of and relations between individuals, locations, organization and works of art of van Gogh and others.\n\nAll this requires a thorough understanding of the ZyLAB ONE software, but also of modern artificial intelligence, data science, text-mining, artificial intelligence and data visualization techniques algorithms.\n\nKey challenges\n\nThe key challenges in this project are that text from some of the material is based on low quality document scans, these have resulted in a lower quality text generated by using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools. In addition, the documents are highly unstructured and very different in format.\n\nIn addition, individual names (especially those transliterated from non-Roman spellings) have resulted in many different spelling variations, as have historical spelling variations.\n\nThe information extraction and machine learning methods used therefor have to be robust against such OCR errors, misspellings, transliteration and historical spelling variations.\n\nResearch Questions\n\nThe research questions in this research are:\n\nHow and which information extraction and data visualization methods be used to analyze the completeness and consistency of the information and meta data\nWhich information extraction and machine learning methods are useful to provide additional insights into the content of the documentation of the van Gogh Museum.\nHow can such methods be made robust against OCR errors, but also against misspellings, transliteration and spelling variations.\nHow can the quality (quantitative and qualitative) of these methods be measured.\nWhat is the quality of the results of these methods.\n\nOther Expected / Desired Outcomes\n\nThe methods used have to interact with all the information (including all metadata) in the ZyLAB platform via the ZyLAB API\u2019s, now and in the future.\n\nMore Information\n\nMore information on R&D projects which ultimately find their application in the ZyLAB ONE platform can be found here: https://textmining.nu\n\nContact\n\nIf you are interested, please contact us at hrm@zylab.com, or leave your details on this page.", "Rating": -1.0, "Employment Type": -1, "Company URL": "https://indeed.nl/rc/clk?jk=8e80491e2209532a&from=vj&mvj=0&vjfrom=vjs&pos=bottom&astse=4a9188bef8453e70&assa=4691", "Job URL": "https://nl.indeed.com/vacature-bekijken?jk=8e80491e2209532a&fccid=cef8d5469db38990&vjs=3", "Job Age": "14 dagen geleden", "Job Age Number": "14 dagen geleden", "Collection Date": "2021-01-22", "Language": "en", "Gender": "Female"}, {"index": 11, "Search Keyword": "mining", "Platform": "Indeed", "Job ID": "p_c5b060d74728e0c0", "Job Title": "Quantitative Analysts", "Company Name": "Trefi", "Location": " Amsterdam", "Job Description": "We know that you have a strong analytical (academic) background and that you love data mining.\n\nOf course you have been programming in Java, or is C++ your language?\n\n\nGuess what, your skills can change the world.\n\n\nIn our case the world of finance.\n\nNot only will you design, develop, implement and calibrate new models but actually have impact!\n\nTo tell you a little bit about our company:\n\nWhat we do effects the life of business owners all over the world.

Waar nodig voorzien wij hen van tijdelijk inkomen. Zo bieden we onze klanten nieuw perspectief op deelname aan de maatschappij. In totaal hebben we 1,5 miljoen klanten, die we snel en deskundig dienstverlening op maat bieden. De breedte van onze dienstverlening en het maatschappelijke speelveld zorgen voor een veelzijdige en dynamische werkomgeving met veel aandacht voor persoonlijke ontplooiing.\n\nDe directie Handhaving richt zich op het bevorderen van het draagvlak voor de sociale zekerheid door naleving van wetten en regels te stimuleren. Zowel preventie als repressie dragen daar aan bij. Preventie beoogt te voorkomen dat klanten onbedoeld de regels overtreden. Repressie richt zich op de klanten die dat bewust doen. De directie Handhaving intensiveert haar activiteiten met betrekking tot het voeren van UWV-breed risicomanagement-handhaving. Als risico\u2019s op bewuste en onbewuste regelovertreding door de klant UWV-breed continu in beeld zijn, dan kunnen maatregelen worden getroffen om onbewuste regelovertreding beter te voorkomen en bewuste regelovertreding te bestrijden. Het doel daarvan is om een grotere mate van klantgerichtheid en rechtvaardigheid in de handhaving te verwezenlijken. Omdat er een verdergaande trend te zien is in de richting van complexe, grootschalige fraudevormen focust de directie Handhaving de komende jaren naast individuele gevalsbehandeling op thematisch gerichte onderzoeken. Daarnaast maakt Handhaving de komende jaren de beweging naar een meer data gedreven en risico-gerichte manier van werken.\n\nDe afdeling IM Handhaving valt onder de directie Handhaving. De eenheid (bestaande uit ca. 25 medewerkers) is verantwoordelijk voor de vertaling van wet- en regelgeving naar de operationele IT-praktijk en draagt zorg voor het ontwikkelen en realiseren van zo optimaal mogelijke bedrijfs- en werkprocessen en ICT-ondersteuning voor de directie Handhaving. Tevens stelt de afdeling beleidsvoorstellen op, die gericht zijn op de bedrijfsinrichting. De afdeling vertaalt het directiebeleid naar het vakgebied informatiemanagement en adviseert de directie over innovatie in samenhang met de informatiehuishouding.

The internships or graduation project will allow you to learn how data science technology is applied in commercial and government organizations for mission critical applications and at the same time execute thorough scientific research.\n\nThe next internship/graduation project is available:\n\nProblem\n\n\u201cData is the new oil (or gold)\u201d. Recent progress in machine learning has shown exiting results in various text-mining applications such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), entity linking, but also in sentiment-, emotion-, and cynicism detection. Both traditional algorithms such as Support Vector Machines and Deep-learning models such as LSTM perform at levels well above human performance.\n\nThe solution to the above problems is no longer in the algorithms, but it is in the lack of (sufficient) annotated training data. Especially for less prevailing languages.\n\nManual creation of such data sets is too slow, too labor intensive and too expensive. In addition to this, human annotators are error prune, especially for the tedious and dreary work adding manual annotations. Sometimes, human annotations vary up to 40% for a given task.\n\nRecent research indicated that certain machine learning algorithms such as SVM are very robust against wrong training data. Experiments where deliberately up to 30% of wrong training data was added to the training set, show that the classifiers were still able to reach similar results as classifiers trained with perfect data, albeit only a bit slower.\n\nBased on these findings, this project focusses on creating such annotated training-data sets automatically. Various approaches exist already to do this:\n\nBootstrap a basic classifier with a small manually annotated data set and use this classifier to create larger data sets.\nUse links / annotations / structure from Wikipedia to create annotated data sets.\nUse Machine Translation to translate an annotated data set from one language to the other.\n\u2026\n\nCreating a reliable process, including support for development of multi-lingual data sets is the focus of this project.\n\nKey challenges\n\nKey challenges are to design and test such a process. What are the best methods to start? What are the minimal boot strapping data sets required? Can machine translation be used to translate data sets form one language to another? How do we prevent data sets to contain too much wrong data? How can we measure when a data set is too polluted? Etc.\n\nResearch Questions\n\nThe following research questions have to be answered in this project:\n\nHow robust are well known machine learning algorithms such as SVM, CNN or LSTM to wrong training data? Does it only delay the training process or does it also create a lower maximal performance?\nWhat are different methods and processes for (semi) automatic creation of data sets?\nHow good is the performance of such systems (in terms of precision, recall and F1-values)?\nHow can these methods be used to create data sets for other languages?\nWhat post and preprocessing methods can be used to increase the performance of the system?\n\nOther Expected / Desired Outcomes\n\nAt ZyLAB R&D, first a prototype is developed using a very basic approach to set a base line performance. Next, the objective is to use novel methods such as advanced machine learning methods (deep learning, better feature factories, better document representation methods, etc.) to create a better performing system.\n\nDevelopment Environment\n\nAt ZyLAB, develop is done in C# in combination with HTML-5 based on the Angular-6+ framework.\n\nData Sets\n\nZyLAB has several data sets to train and validate the performance of such systems.

Als risico\u2019s op bewuste en onbewuste regelovertreding door de klant UWV-breed continu in beeld zijn, dan kunnen maatregelen worden getroffen om onbewuste regelovertreding beter te voorkomen en bewuste regelovertreding te bestrijden. Het doel daarvan is om een grotere mate van klantgerichtheid en rechtvaardigheid in de handhaving te verwezenlijken. Omdat er een verdergaande trend te zien is in de richting van complexe, grootschalige fraudevormen focust de directie Handhaving de komende jaren naast individuele gevalsbehandeling op thematisch gerichte onderzoeken. Daarnaast maakt Handhaving de komende jaren de beweging naar een meer data gedreven en risico-gerichte manier van werken.\n\nDe afdeling IM Handhaving valt onder de directie Handhaving. De eenheid (bestaande uit ca. 25 medewerkers) is verantwoordelijk voor de vertaling van wet- en regelgeving naar de operationele IT-praktijk en draagt zorg voor het ontwikkelen en realiseren van zo optimaal mogelijke bedrijfs- en werkprocessen en ICT-ondersteuning voor de directie Handhaving. Tevens stelt de afdeling beleidsvoorstellen op, die gericht zijn op de bedrijfsinrichting. De afdeling vertaalt het directiebeleid naar het vakgebied informatiemanagement en adviseert de directie over innovatie in samenhang met de informatiehuishouding. Wij werken steeds meer in multidisciplinaire teams.\n\n Kom je als procesontwerper bij ons werken, dan kies je voor een uitdagende omgeving en voor samenwerking met interessante disciplines.

We zoeken iemand voor dit bekende consultancybureau. Je krijgt hier volop begeleiding en veel verantwoordelijkheid, waardoor je je in korte tijd enorm kunt ontwikkelen.\nOver de opdrachtgever\nBij deze big4 is er, ondanks het volume van een paar duizend man, veel aandacht voor persoonlijke groei en ontwikkeling. De ambitie is om hun top 20-klanten in alles zo goed en optimaal mogelijk te kunnen bedienen vanuit advisory en daarom hebben jouw adviestrajecten vaak een multidisciplinair karakter. Daarnaast heeft dit bureau een uitgebreid netwerk van specialisten, zowel intern als extern, nationaal en internationaal.\nConsultants en mensen uit de business maakten de overstap naar deze big4 door onder meer het hoge niveau van opdrachten, het volledig kunnen richten op risk en compliance- in plaats van internal audit-vraagstukken of \u2013 vooral vanuit de business \u2013 omdat ze hier zeer diverse opdrachten bij verschillende opdrachtgevers kunnen doen.\nDe vacature valt binnen de consulting groep die klanten adviseert bij fusies en overnames, organisatieontwikkeling, performance improvement en crisismanagement. Het gaat om generiek risk management; alle invalshoeken van risk komen aan bod. Een creatieve geest is dus een must om tot goede oplossingen te komen.\nOver de functie\nWaar in de business risk en compliance nogal eens wordt ervaren als een obstakel, draait hier alles om de \u2018positieve benadering\u2019 van de bijbehorende vraagstukken. Je helpt bedrijven met groeidoelstellingen hun bedrijf in control te houden. Je richt bijvoorbeeld de governance in, zet een risk framework op of stimuleert ethisch en risicobewustzijn. Je geeft dus niet alleen advies, maar helpt de klant ook door het te implementeren en fysiek toe te passen. Teams bestaan daarom niet alleen uit je directe collega\u2019s, maar omvatten ook collega\u2019s uit andere practices (zoals HR en M&A).\nDe partners van deze afdeling zijn nauw betrokken bij hun medewerkers en vinden het belangrijk actief te blijven binnen de business. Hierdoor is er de mogelijkheid voor continue feedback. Je leercurve is dus groot. Hoewel je voornamelijk bij je klanten zit, staat hun deur altijd open om jou te helpen met klantvragen of persoonlijke dilemma\u2019s om jouw doelen te helpen realiseren.\nJe doet opdrachten bij diverse bedrijven, vaak meerdere naast elkaar, vari\u00ebrend van drie tot zes maanden of langer. Bovendien vloeien er uit een opdracht vaak vervolgopdrachten. Als (senior) manager manage jij (een deel van) het team om samen het einddoel te behalen. Je krijgt daarnaast alle ruimte voor andersoortige projecten, zoals het geven van trainingen, artikelen schrijven of bijvoorbeeld de recruitment van je team op te pakken.\nVoorbeeld van een opdracht:\nHet gehele risk- en controlframework opzetten voor een bekende retailer. Zij groeien zo hard dat het noodzakelijk is dat ze hierin goed worden begeleid. Dit is een voorbeeld waar onze opdrachtgever al meer dan een jaar mee bezig is en waar maar werk uit blijft voortkomen. Daarnaast neemt een andere afdeling binnen hetzelfde bureau het HR- en strategiestuk op zich, waardoor je ook nauw samenwerkt met die afdelingen.\nDe ideale kandidaat\nDe ideale kandidaat heeft 6-10 jaar ervaring in consultancy of in commerci\u00eble producten- of dienstensector. Bijv. industrial products, retail & consumer, telecommunicatie, energy, utilities & mining.\nJe hebt werkervaring op het snijvlak van strategie-executie, corporate governance en risico- en/of regulatory compliance management.\nJe hebt affiniteit met technologisch ontwikkelingen in dit werkveld.\nJe hebt ervaring met het (projectmatig) aansturen van teams.\nJe bent ondernemend, creatief, gepassioneerd, ambitieus en een teamwerker.\nJe werkt vanuit de visie dat je de klant wil helpen, want wat je doet heeft direct impact op het bedrijf.\nReden van de vacature\nDoor de langdurigere en uitgebreidere trajecten en verschuiving in accounting, is er meer werk dan de afdeling aankan. De practice groeit enorm. Hierdoor liggen er mooie kansen om jezelf te ontwikkelen.\nSollicitatieprocedure\nNa een gesprek bij Badenoch + Clark volgt een verkennend kennismakingsgesprek bij de opdrachtgever, daarna volgen nog twee gesprekken. Een assessment maakt onderdeel uit van de procedure.\nContact\nGe\u00efnteresseerd in deze functie? En pas je in het profiel?

Waar nodig voorzien wij hen van tijdelijk inkomen. Zo bieden we onze klanten nieuw perspectief op deelname aan de maatschappij. In totaal hebben we 1,5 miljoen klanten, die we snel en deskundig dienstverlening op maat bieden. De breedte van onze dienstverlening en het maatschappelijke speelveld zorgen voor een veelzijdige en dynamische werkomgeving met veel aandacht voor persoonlijke ontplooiing.\n\nDe directie Handhaving richt zich op het bevorderen van het draagvlak voor de sociale zekerheid door naleving van wetten en regels te stimuleren. Zowel preventie als repressie dragen daar aan bij. Preventie beoogt te voorkomen dat klanten onbedoeld de regels overtreden. Repressie richt zich op de klanten die dat bewust doen. De directie Handhaving intensiveert haar activiteiten met betrekking tot het voeren van UWV-breed risicomanagement-handhaving. Als risico\u2019s op bewuste en onbewuste regelovertreding door de klant UWV-breed continu in beeld zijn, dan kunnen maatregelen worden getroffen om onbewuste regelovertreding beter te voorkomen en bewuste regelovertreding te bestrijden. Het doel daarvan is om een grotere mate van klantgerichtheid en rechtvaardigheid in de handhaving te verwezenlijken. Omdat er een verdergaande trend te zien is in de richting van complexe, grootschalige fraudevormen focust de directie Handhaving de komende jaren naast individuele gevalsbehandeling op thematisch gerichte onderzoeken. Daarnaast maakt Handhaving de komende jaren de beweging naar een meer data gedreven en risico-gerichte manier van werken.\n\nDe afdeling IM Handhaving valt onder de directie Handhaving. De eenheid (bestaande uit ca. 25 medewerkers) is verantwoordelijk voor de vertaling van wet- en regelgeving naar de operationele IT-praktijk en draagt zorg voor het ontwikkelen en realiseren van zo optimaal mogelijke bedrijfs- en werkprocessen en ICT-ondersteuning voor de directie Handhaving. Tevens stelt de afdeling beleidsvoorstellen op, die gericht zijn op de bedrijfsinrichting. De afdeling vertaalt het directiebeleid naar het vakgebied informatiemanagement en adviseert de directie over innovatie in samenhang met de informatiehuishouding.

The internships or graduation project will allow you to learn how data science technology is applied in commercial and government organizations for mission critical applications and at the same time execute thorough scientific research.\n\nThe next internship/graduation project is available:\n\nProblem\n\n\u201cData is the new oil (or gold)\u201d. Recent progress in machine learning has shown exiting results in various text-mining applications such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), entity linking, but also in sentiment-, emotion-, and cynicism detection. Both traditional algorithms such as Support Vector Machines and Deep-learning models such as LSTM perform at levels well above human performance.\n\nThe solution to the above problems is no longer in the algorithms, but it is in the lack of (sufficient) annotated training data. Especially for less prevailing languages.\n\nManual creation of such data sets is too slow, too labor intensive and too expensive. In addition to this, human annotators are error prune, especially for the tedious and dreary work adding manual annotations. Sometimes, human annotations vary up to 40% for a given task.\n\nRecent research indicated that certain machine learning algorithms such as SVM are very robust against wrong training data. Experiments where deliberately up to 30% of wrong training data was added to the training set, show that the classifiers were still able to reach similar results as classifiers trained with perfect data, albeit only a bit slower.\n\nBased on these findings, this project focusses on creating such annotated training-data sets automatically. Various approaches exist already to do this:\n\nBootstrap a basic classifier with a small manually annotated data set and use this classifier to create larger data sets.\nUse links / annotations / structure from Wikipedia to create annotated data sets.\nUse Machine Translation to translate an annotated data set from one language to the other.\n\u2026\n\nCreating a reliable process, including support for development of multi-lingual data sets is the focus of this project.\n\nKey challenges\n\nKey challenges are to design and test such a process. What are the best methods to start? What are the minimal boot strapping data sets required? Can machine translation be used to translate data sets form one language to another? How do we prevent data sets to contain too much wrong data? How can we measure when a data set is too polluted? Etc.\n\nResearch Questions\n\nThe following research questions have to be answered in this project:\n\nHow robust are well known machine learning algorithms such as SVM, CNN or LSTM to wrong training data? Does it only delay the training process or does it also create a lower maximal performance?\nWhat are different methods and processes for (semi) automatic creation of data sets?\nHow good is the performance of such systems (in terms of precision, recall and F1-values)?\nHow can these methods be used to create data sets for other languages?\nWhat post and preprocessing methods can be used to increase the performance of the system?\n\nOther Expected / Desired Outcomes\n\nAt ZyLAB R&D, first a prototype is developed using a very basic approach to set a base line performance. Next, the objective is to use novel methods such as advanced machine learning methods (deep learning, better feature factories, better document representation methods, etc.) to create a better performing system.\n\nDevelopment Environment\n\nAt ZyLAB, develop is done in C# in combination with HTML-5 based on the Angular-6+ framework.\n\nData Sets\n\nZyLAB has several data sets to train and validate the performance of such systems.

We zoeken iemand voor dit bekende consultancybureau. Je krijgt hier volop begeleiding en veel verantwoordelijkheid, waardoor je je in korte tijd enorm kunt ontwikkelen.\nOver de opdrachtgever\nBij deze big4 is er, ondanks het volume van een paar duizend man, veel aandacht voor persoonlijke groei en ontwikkeling. De ambitie is om hun top 20-klanten in alles zo goed en optimaal mogelijk te kunnen bedienen vanuit advisory en daarom hebben jouw adviestrajecten vaak een multidisciplinair karakter. Daarnaast heeft dit bureau een uitgebreid netwerk van specialisten, zowel intern als extern, nationaal en internationaal.\nConsultants en mensen uit de business maakten de overstap naar deze big4 door onder meer het hoge niveau van opdrachten, het volledig kunnen richten op risk en compliance- in plaats van internal audit-vraagstukken of \u2013 vooral vanuit de business \u2013 omdat ze hier zeer diverse opdrachten bij verschillende opdrachtgevers kunnen doen.\nDe vacature valt binnen de consulting groep die klanten adviseert bij fusies en overnames, organisatieontwikkeling, performance improvement en crisismanagement. Het gaat om generiek risk management; alle invalshoeken van risk komen aan bod. Een creatieve geest is dus een must om tot goede oplossingen te komen.\nOver de functie\nWaar in de business risk en compliance nogal eens wordt ervaren als een obstakel, draait hier alles om de \u2018positieve benadering\u2019 van de bijbehorende vraagstukken. Je helpt bedrijven met groeidoelstellingen hun bedrijf in control te houden. Je richt bijvoorbeeld de governance in, zet een risk framework op of stimuleert ethisch en risicobewustzijn. Je geeft dus niet alleen advies, maar helpt de klant ook door het te implementeren en fysiek toe te passen. Teams bestaan daarom niet alleen uit je directe collega\u2019s, maar omvatten ook collega\u2019s uit andere practices (zoals HR en M&A).\nDe partners van deze afdeling zijn nauw betrokken bij hun medewerkers en vinden het belangrijk actief te blijven binnen de business. Hierdoor is er de mogelijkheid voor continue feedback. Je leercurve is dus groot. Hoewel je voornamelijk bij je klanten zit, staat hun deur altijd open om jou te helpen met klantvragen of persoonlijke dilemma\u2019s om jouw doelen te helpen realiseren.\nJe doet opdrachten bij diverse bedrijven, vaak meerdere naast elkaar, vari\u00ebrend van drie tot zes maanden of langer. Bovendien vloeien er uit een opdracht vaak vervolgopdrachten. Als (senior) manager manage jij (een deel van) het team om samen het einddoel te behalen. Je krijgt daarnaast alle ruimte voor andersoortige projecten, zoals het geven van trainingen, artikelen schrijven of bijvoorbeeld de recruitment van je team op te pakken.\nVoorbeeld van een opdracht:\nHet gehele risk- en controlframework opzetten voor een bekende retailer. Zij groeien zo hard dat het noodzakelijk is dat ze hierin goed worden begeleid. Dit is een voorbeeld waar onze opdrachtgever al meer dan een jaar mee bezig is en waar maar werk uit blijft voortkomen. Daarnaast neemt een andere afdeling binnen hetzelfde bureau het HR- en strategiestuk op zich, waardoor je ook nauw samenwerkt met die afdelingen.\nDe ideale kandidaat\nDe ideale kandidaat heeft 6-10 jaar ervaring in consultancy of in commerci\u00eble producten- of dienstensector. Bijv. industrial products, retail & consumer, telecommunicatie, energy, utilities & mining.\nJe hebt werkervaring op het snijvlak van strategie-executie, corporate governance en risico- en/of regulatory compliance management.\nJe hebt affiniteit met technologisch ontwikkelingen in dit werkveld.\nJe hebt ervaring met het (projectmatig) aansturen van teams.\nJe bent ondernemend, creatief, gepassioneerd, ambitieus en een teamwerker.\nJe werkt vanuit de visie dat je de klant wil helpen, want wat je doet heeft direct impact op het bedrijf.\nReden van de vacature\nDoor de langdurigere en uitgebreidere trajecten en verschuiving in accounting, is er meer werk dan de afdeling aankan. De practice groeit enorm. Hierdoor liggen er mooie kansen om jezelf te ontwikkelen.\nSollicitatieprocedure\nNa een gesprek bij Badenoch + Clark volgt een verkennend kennismakingsgesprek bij de opdrachtgever, daarna volgen nog twee gesprekken.

Waar nodig voorzien wij hen van tijdelijk inkomen. Zo bieden we onze klanten nieuw perspectief op deelname aan de maatschappij. In totaal hebben we 1,5 miljoen klanten, die we snel en deskundig dienstverlening op maat bieden. De breedte van onze dienstverlening en het maatschappelijke speelveld zorgen voor een veelzijdige en dynamische werkomgeving met veel aandacht voor persoonlijke ontplooiing.\n\nDe directie Handhaving richt zich op het bevorderen van het draagvlak voor de sociale zekerheid door naleving van wetten en regels te stimuleren. Zowel preventie als repressie dragen daar aan bij. Preventie beoogt te voorkomen dat klanten onbedoeld de regels overtreden. Repressie richt zich op de klanten die dat bewust doen. De directie Handhaving intensiveert haar activiteiten met betrekking tot het voeren van UWV-breed risicomanagement-handhaving. Als risico\u2019s op bewuste en onbewuste regelovertreding door de klant UWV-breed continu in beeld zijn, dan kunnen maatregelen worden getroffen om onbewuste regelovertreding beter te voorkomen en bewuste regelovertreding te bestrijden. Het doel daarvan is om een grotere mate van klantgerichtheid en rechtvaardigheid in de handhaving te verwezenlijken. Omdat er een verdergaande trend te zien is in de richting van complexe, grootschalige fraudevormen focust de directie Handhaving de komende jaren naast individuele gevalsbehandeling op thematisch gerichte onderzoeken. Daarnaast maakt Handhaving de komende jaren de beweging naar een meer data gedreven en risico-gerichte manier van werken.\n\nDe afdeling IM Handhaving valt onder de directie Handhaving. De eenheid (bestaande uit ca. 25 medewerkers) is verantwoordelijk voor de vertaling van wet- en regelgeving naar de operationele IT-praktijk en draagt zorg voor het ontwikkelen en realiseren van zo optimaal mogelijke bedrijfs- en werkprocessen en ICT-ondersteuning voor de directie Handhaving. Tevens stelt de afdeling beleidsvoorstellen op, die gericht zijn op de bedrijfsinrichting. De afdeling vertaalt het directiebeleid naar het vakgebied informatiemanagement en adviseert de directie over innovatie in samenhang met de informatiehuishouding.

The internships or graduation project will allow you to learn how data science technology is applied in commercial and government organizations for mission critical applications and at the same time execute thorough scientific research.\n\nThe next internship/graduation project is available:\n\nProblem\n\n\u201cData is the new oil (or gold)\u201d. Recent progress in machine learning has shown exiting results in various text-mining applications such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), entity linking, but also in sentiment-, emotion-, and cynicism detection. Both traditional algorithms such as Support Vector Machines and Deep-learning models such as LSTM perform at levels well above human performance.\n\nThe solution to the above problems is no longer in the algorithms, but it is in the lack of (sufficient) annotated training data. Especially for less prevailing languages.\n\nManual creation of such data sets is too slow, too labor intensive and too expensive. In addition to this, human annotators are error prune, especially for the tedious and dreary work adding manual annotations. Sometimes, human annotations vary up to 40% for a given task.\n\nRecent research indicated that certain machine learning algorithms such as SVM are very robust against wrong training data. Experiments where deliberately up to 30% of wrong training data was added to the training set, show that the classifiers were still able to reach similar results as classifiers trained with perfect data, albeit only a bit slower.\n\nBased on these findings, this project focusses on creating such annotated training-data sets automatically. Various approaches exist already to do this:\n\nBootstrap a basic classifier with a small manually annotated data set and use this classifier to create larger data sets.\nUse links / annotations / structure from Wikipedia to create annotated data sets.\nUse Machine Translation to translate an annotated data set from one language to the other.\n\u2026\n\nCreating a reliable process, including support for development of multi-lingual data sets is the focus of this project.\n\nKey challenges\n\nKey challenges are to design and test such a process. What are the best methods to start? What are the minimal boot strapping data sets required? Can machine translation be used to translate data sets form one language to another? How do we prevent data sets to contain too much wrong data? How can we measure when a data set is too polluted? Etc.\n\nResearch Questions\n\nThe following research questions have to be answered in this project:\n\nHow robust are well known machine learning algorithms such as SVM, CNN or LSTM to wrong training data? Does it only delay the training process or does it also create a lower maximal performance?\nWhat are different methods and processes for (semi) automatic creation of data sets?\nHow good is the performance of such systems (in terms of precision, recall and F1-values)?\nHow can these methods be used to create data sets for other languages?\nWhat post and preprocessing methods can be used to increase the performance of the system?\n\nOther Expected / Desired Outcomes\n\nAt ZyLAB R&D, first a prototype is developed using a very basic approach to set a base line performance. Next, the objective is to use novel methods such as advanced machine learning methods (deep learning, better feature factories, better document representation methods, etc.) to create a better performing system.\n\nDevelopment Environment\n\nAt ZyLAB, develop is done in C# in combination with HTML-5 based on the Angular-6+ framework.\n\nData Sets\n\nZyLAB has several data sets to train and validate the performance of such systems. More information on other projects can be found here:\n\nhttps://textminingum.wordpress.com/\n\nCompensation\n\nDepending on your programming skills, ZyLAB will pay you an internship fee which is significant higher than what most other companies would pay you.

De breedte van onze dienstverlening en het maatschappelijke speelveld zorgen voor een veelzijdige en dynamische werkomgeving met veel aandacht voor persoonlijke ontplooiing.\n\nDe directie Handhaving richt zich op het bevorderen van het draagvlak voor de sociale zekerheid door naleving van wetten en regels te stimuleren. Zowel preventie als repressie dragen daar aan bij. Preventie beoogt te voorkomen dat klanten onbedoeld de regels overtreden. Repressie richt zich op de klanten die dat bewust doen. De directie Handhaving intensiveert haar activiteiten met betrekking tot het voeren van UWV-breed risicomanagement-handhaving. Als risico\u2019s op bewuste en onbewuste regelovertreding door de klant UWV-breed continu in beeld zijn, dan kunnen maatregelen worden getroffen om onbewuste regelovertreding beter te voorkomen en bewuste regelovertreding te bestrijden. Het doel daarvan is om een grotere mate van klantgerichtheid en rechtvaardigheid in de handhaving te verwezenlijken. Omdat er een verdergaande trend te zien is in de richting van complexe, grootschalige fraudevormen focust de directie Handhaving de komende jaren naast individuele gevalsbehandeling op thematisch gerichte onderzoeken. Daarnaast maakt Handhaving de komende jaren de beweging naar een meer data gedreven en risico-gerichte manier van werken.\n\nDe afdeling IM Handhaving valt onder de directie Handhaving. De eenheid (bestaande uit ca. 25 medewerkers) is verantwoordelijk voor de vertaling van wet- en regelgeving naar de operationele IT-praktijk en draagt zorg voor het ontwikkelen en realiseren van zo optimaal mogelijke bedrijfs- en werkprocessen en ICT-ondersteuning voor de directie Handhaving. Tevens stelt de afdeling beleidsvoorstellen op, die gericht zijn op de bedrijfsinrichting. De afdeling vertaalt het directiebeleid naar het vakgebied informatiemanagement en adviseert de directie over innovatie in samenhang met de informatiehuishouding. Wij werken steeds meer in multidisciplinaire teams.\n\n Kom je als procesontwerper bij ons werken, dan kies je voor een uitdagende omgeving en voor samenwerking met interessante disciplines.

We zoeken iemand voor dit bekende consultancybureau. Je krijgt hier volop begeleiding en veel verantwoordelijkheid, waardoor je je in korte tijd enorm kunt ontwikkelen.\nOver de opdrachtgever\nBij deze big4 is er, ondanks het volume van een paar duizend man, veel aandacht voor persoonlijke groei en ontwikkeling. De ambitie is om hun top 20-klanten in alles zo goed en optimaal mogelijk te kunnen bedienen vanuit advisory en daarom hebben jouw adviestrajecten vaak een multidisciplinair karakter. Daarnaast heeft dit bureau een uitgebreid netwerk van specialisten, zowel intern als extern, nationaal en internationaal.\nConsultants en mensen uit de business maakten de overstap naar deze big4 door onder meer het hoge niveau van opdrachten, het volledig kunnen richten op risk en compliance- in plaats van internal audit-vraagstukken of \u2013 vooral vanuit de business \u2013 omdat ze hier zeer diverse opdrachten bij verschillende opdrachtgevers kunnen doen.\nDe vacature valt binnen de consulting groep die klanten adviseert bij fusies en overnames, organisatieontwikkeling, performance improvement en crisismanagement. Het gaat om generiek risk management; alle invalshoeken van risk komen aan bod. Een creatieve geest is dus een must om tot goede oplossingen te komen.\nOver de functie\nWaar in de business risk en compliance nogal eens wordt ervaren als een obstakel, draait hier alles om de \u2018positieve benadering\u2019 van de bijbehorende vraagstukken. Je helpt bedrijven met groeidoelstellingen hun bedrijf in control te houden. Je richt bijvoorbeeld de governance in, zet een risk framework op of stimuleert ethisch en risicobewustzijn. Je geeft dus niet alleen advies, maar helpt de klant ook door het te implementeren en fysiek toe te passen. Teams bestaan daarom niet alleen uit je directe collega\u2019s, maar omvatten ook collega\u2019s uit andere practices (zoals HR en M&A).\nDe partners van deze afdeling zijn nauw betrokken bij hun medewerkers en vinden het belangrijk actief te blijven binnen de business. Hierdoor is er de mogelijkheid voor continue feedback. Je leercurve is dus groot. Hoewel je voornamelijk bij je klanten zit, staat hun deur altijd open om jou te helpen met klantvragen of persoonlijke dilemma\u2019s om jouw doelen te helpen realiseren.\nJe doet opdrachten bij diverse bedrijven, vaak meerdere naast elkaar, vari\u00ebrend van drie tot zes maanden of langer. Bovendien vloeien er uit een opdracht vaak vervolgopdrachten. Als (senior) manager manage jij (een deel van) het team om samen het einddoel te behalen. Je krijgt daarnaast alle ruimte voor andersoortige projecten, zoals het geven van trainingen, artikelen schrijven of bijvoorbeeld de recruitment van je team op te pakken.\nVoorbeeld van een opdracht:\nHet gehele risk- en controlframework opzetten voor een bekende retailer. Zij groeien zo hard dat het noodzakelijk is dat ze hierin goed worden begeleid. Dit is een voorbeeld waar onze opdrachtgever al meer dan een jaar mee bezig is en waar maar werk uit blijft voortkomen. Daarnaast neemt een andere afdeling binnen hetzelfde bureau het HR- en strategiestuk op zich, waardoor je ook nauw samenwerkt met die afdelingen.\nDe ideale kandidaat\nDe ideale kandidaat heeft 6-10 jaar ervaring in consultancy of in commerci\u00eble producten- of dienstensector. Bijv. industrial products, retail & consumer, telecommunicatie, energy, utilities & mining.\nJe hebt werkervaring op het snijvlak van strategie-executie, corporate governance en risico- en/of regulatory compliance management.\nJe hebt affiniteit met technologisch ontwikkelingen in dit werkveld.\nJe hebt ervaring met het (projectmatig) aansturen van teams.\nJe bent ondernemend, creatief, gepassioneerd, ambitieus en een teamwerker.\nJe werkt vanuit de visie dat je de klant wil helpen, want wat je doet heeft direct impact op het bedrijf.\nReden van de vacature\nDoor de langdurigere en uitgebreidere trajecten en verschuiving in accounting, is er meer werk dan de afdeling aankan. De practice groeit enorm. Hierdoor liggen er mooie kansen om jezelf te ontwikkelen.\nSollicitatieprocedure\nNa een gesprek bij Badenoch + Clark volgt een verkennend kennismakingsgesprek bij de opdrachtgever, daarna volgen nog twee gesprekken. Een assessment maakt onderdeel uit van de procedure.\nContact\nGe\u00efnteresseerd in deze functie? En pas je in het profiel?

The internships or graduation project will allow you to learn how data science technology is applied in commercial and government organizations for mission critical applications and at the same time execute thorough scientific research.\n\nThe next internship/graduation project is available:\n\nProblem\n\nIn criminal and fraud investigation, large collections of emails, social media or other forms of communication are analyzed. Often such collections consist of Tb\u2019s of unstructured information. Search is no longer good enough to find the needle in the haystack. With 30 years\u2019 experience in fraud and criminal investigations, ZyLAB has noticed that when something goes wrong in a criminal scheme, relevant communication often contains high levels of emotions, communication or cursing. Detecting such patterns is a complex task. Keyword search is generating too much noise and it is hard to capture the right linguistic context using traditional search techniques. Initial experiments using machine learning and annotated data sets has shown to be performing at par with human performance for such tasks. In this project, we would like to develop machine-learning based methods to recognize emotions, sentiments, cursing, or cynicism in various languages.\n\nKey challenges\n\nThe key challenges in this project are the ability to deal with new types emotions, sentiments, cursing or cynicism (e.g. names that are unique and that the system has never seen before) and dealing with negations, subjectivity or ambiguity of emotions, sentiments, cursing or cynicism.\n\nThe system has to use annotated data sets in various languages to learn how to identify and extract such patterns. The system needs to approximate human performance (70-80% precision and recall).\n\nResearch Questions\n\nWhat are the best machine learning algorithms to teach a system to recognize and extract emotions, sentiments, cursing or cynicism.\nWhat are the best features to use for the machine learning.\nHow good is the performance of such systems (in terms of precision, recall and F1-values).\nWhat relations can be taught and how does the performance between different types of relations vary?\nWhat post and preprocessing methods can be used to increase the performance of the system?\n\nOther Expected / Desired Outcomes\n\nAt ZyLAB R&D, first a prototype is developed using a very basic approach to set a base line performance. Next, the objective is to use novel methods such as advanced machine learning methods (deep learning, better feature factories, better document representation methods, etc.) to create a better performing system.\n\nData Sets\n\nZyLAB has several data sets to train and validate the performance of such systems.More information on other projects can be found here: https://textminingum.wordpress.com/\n\nCompensation\n\nDepending on your programming skills, ZyLAB will pay you an internship fee which is significant higher than what most other companies would pay you.

ZyLAB applies its specialization in many ways: by searching in big batches of data with requests under the Public Access Act, by finding key information in large datasets in the context of competition law, making information 'GDPR-proof' et cetera.\n\nMany law students of the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences have already conducted their third-year internships and fourth-year graduation research at ZyLAB. Due to the success of these internships, ZyLAB is looking for new students for 3rd year internships and 4th year graduation projects.\n\nFor who\n\nThis internship is best for International Law students (University of Applied Science) who:\n\nhave a good understanding of the legal aspects of for instance handling public records requests (\u201cWet Openbaarheid Bestuur\u201d or WOB), the answering of regulatory requests or fulfilling subject access requests, and\nare interested in applying legal technology to increase the quality and efficiency of such processes.\n\nLocation\n\nThe internship is at the office in Amsterdam.\n\nProblem\n\nLegalTech is more popular than ever. However, the large-scale adaptation of LegalTech is slowed down by a number of factors:\n\nUser adaptation (or the lack of ease of use),\nTranslating steps in the legal process into technology steps,\nLegal defensibility and transparency of such technology,\nEmbedding technology in legal operations.\n\nMany LegalTech applications use typical IT, AI and Data Science jargon, which is not understood by legal professionals. On the other hand, law books and case law use their own jargon, which is not understood by IT professionals and data scientists.\n\nIn order to bring these two worlds more together, this internship focusses on mapping the specific legal requirements of large information requests to the ZyLAB ONE eDiscovery software. Especially for business cases such as litigation, arbitration, subject access requests (GDPR), public records requests (verzoeken Wet Openbaarheid Bestuur \u2013 Wob), internal investigations, etc.\n\nIn addition, these internships should also document legal requirements needed to use technology for such processes and safeguard issues as privacy, security, and data protection at the same time.\n\nKey challenges\n\nThe key challenges in this project are the mapping of legal terminology and requirements to that of the LegalTech world, AI and Data Science in particular. This requires a thorough understanding of all legal aspects of a certain application, as well as the ZyLAB ONE software, including its artificial intelligence and data science based machine learning and text-mining algorithms.\n\nResearch Questions\n\nFor a particular legal process, what are the specific requirement from a legal point of view when LegalTech is applied?\nHow can these requirements be embedded in the LegalTech process?\nHow can the requirements be audited and validated?\nHow can best practices best be document in a document, which is understood and accepted by both legal and IT professionals?\n\nOther Expected / Desired Outcomes\n\nThe desired outcome is a well-documented best-practice guideline for the use of ZyLAB ONE software on a specific legal process.\n\nContact\n\nIf you are interested, please contact us at hrm@zylab.com, or reach out to us via our social media channels.", "Rating": -1.0, "Employment Type": -1, "Company URL": "https://indeed.nl/rc/clk?jk=541b6b0bb2f2ccc5&from=vj&mvj=0&vjfrom=vjs&pos=bottom&astse=91bb0a76c248879c&assa=7619", "Job URL": "https://nl.indeed.com/vacature-bekijken?jk=541b6b0bb2f2ccc5&fccid=cef8d5469db38990&vjs=3", "Job Age": "14 dagen geleden", "Job Age Number": "14 dagen geleden", "Collection Date": "2021-01-22", "Language": null, "Gender": "Neutral"}, {"index": 4, "Search Keyword": "mining", "Platform": "Indeed", "Job ID": "p_54f215adebccfc0b", "Job Title": "Communications Business Partner", "Company Name": "AkzoNobel", "Location": " Amsterdam", "Job Description": "Date: Jan 12, 2021\nLocation: Amsterdam, NL\nCompany: AkzoNobel\nAkzoNobel has a passion for paint.

This includes but is not limited to: background information on van Gogh paintings and drawings, documentation of special exhibitions, correspondence, personal collections from van Gogh specialists, newspaper clippings about the van Gogh museum and van Gogh\u2019s work, etc.\n\nFor who\n\nThis internship is best for computer science students looking for an internship or MSc graduation project in the fields of text-mining, information retrieval, artificial intelligence, data science or machine learning.\n\nLocation\n\nThe internship location is the Van Gogh Museum in the center of Amsterdam.\n\nProblem\n\nThis particular document collection consists of scanned documents and corresponding meta-information. The meta information may not be complete or can be inconsistent. The van Gogh museum is interested in applying advanced artificial intelligence, data science and data visualization techniques to verify the quality of the meta information, to identify anomalies and to organize and clean up the archives. In addition, the museum is interested in integrating the content of the textual documents with other sources or information which resides in other content management systems. Finally, the museum wishes to understand how advanced information extraction techniques can provide new insights in the history of and relations between individuals, locations, organization and works of art of van Gogh and others.\n\nAll this requires a thorough understanding of the ZyLAB ONE software, but also of modern artificial intelligence, data science, text-mining, artificial intelligence and data visualization techniques algorithms.\n\nKey challenges\n\nThe key challenges in this project are that text from some of the material is based on low quality document scans, these have resulted in a lower quality text generated by using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools. In addition, the documents are highly unstructured and very different in format.\n\nIn addition, individual names (especially those transliterated from non-Roman spellings) have resulted in many different spelling variations, as have historical spelling variations.\n\nThe information extraction and machine learning methods used therefor have to be robust against such OCR errors, misspellings, transliteration and historical spelling variations.\n\nResearch Questions\n\nThe research questions in this research are:\n\nHow and which information extraction and data visualization methods be used to analyze the completeness and consistency of the information and meta data\nWhich information extraction and machine learning methods are useful to provide additional insights into the content of the documentation of the van Gogh Museum.\nHow can such methods be made robust against OCR errors, but also against misspellings, transliteration and spelling variations.\nHow can the quality (quantitative and qualitative) of these methods be measured.\nWhat is the quality of the results of these methods.\n\nOther Expected / Desired Outcomes\n\nThe methods used have to interact with all the information (including all metadata) in the ZyLAB platform via the ZyLAB API\u2019s, now and in the future.\n\nMore Information\n\nMore information on R&D projects which ultimately find their application in the ZyLAB ONE platform can be found here: https://textmining.nu\n\nContact\n\nIf you are interested, please contact us at hrm@zylab.com, or leave your details on this page.", "Rating": -1.0, "Employment Type": -1, "Company URL": "https://indeed.nl/rc/clk?jk=8e80491e2209532a&from=vj&mvj=0&vjfrom=vjs&pos=bottom&astse=4a9188bef8453e70&assa=4691", "Job URL": "https://nl.indeed.com/vacature-bekijken?jk=8e80491e2209532a&fccid=cef8d5469db38990&vjs=3", "Job Age": "14 dagen geleden", "Job Age Number": "14 dagen geleden", "Collection Date": "2021-01-22", "Language": null, "Gender": "Neutral"}, {"index": 11, "Search Keyword": "mining", "Platform": "Indeed", "Job ID": "p_c5b060d74728e0c0", "Job Title": "Quantitative Analysts", "Company Name": "Trefi", "Location": " Amsterdam", "Job Description": "We know that you have a strong analytical (academic) background and that you love data mining.\n\nOf course you have been programming in Java, or is C++ your language?\n\n\nGuess what, your skills can change the world.\n\n\nIn our case the world of finance.\n\nNot only will you design, develop, implement and calibrate new models but actually have impact!\n\nTo tell you a little bit about our company:\n\nWhat we do effects the life of business owners all over the world.

Waar nodig voorzien wij hen van tijdelijk inkomen. Zo bieden we onze klanten nieuw perspectief op deelname aan de maatschappij. In totaal hebben we 1,5 miljoen klanten, die we snel en deskundig dienstverlening op maat bieden. De breedte van onze dienstverlening en het maatschappelijke speelveld zorgen voor een veelzijdige en dynamische werkomgeving met veel aandacht voor persoonlijke ontplooiing.\n\nDe directie Handhaving richt zich op het bevorderen van het draagvlak voor de sociale zekerheid door naleving van wetten en regels te stimuleren. Zowel preventie als repressie dragen daar aan bij. Preventie beoogt te voorkomen dat klanten onbedoeld de regels overtreden. Repressie richt zich op de klanten die dat bewust doen. De directie Handhaving intensiveert haar activiteiten met betrekking tot het voeren van UWV-breed risicomanagement-handhaving. Als risico\u2019s op bewuste en onbewuste regelovertreding door de klant UWV-breed continu in beeld zijn, dan kunnen maatregelen worden getroffen om onbewuste regelovertreding beter te voorkomen en bewuste regelovertreding te bestrijden. Het doel daarvan is om een grotere mate van klantgerichtheid en rechtvaardigheid in de handhaving te verwezenlijken. Omdat er een verdergaande trend te zien is in de richting van complexe, grootschalige fraudevormen focust de directie Handhaving de komende jaren naast individuele gevalsbehandeling op thematisch gerichte onderzoeken. Daarnaast maakt Handhaving de komende jaren de beweging naar een meer data gedreven en risico-gerichte manier van werken.\n\nDe afdeling IM Handhaving valt onder de directie Handhaving. De eenheid (bestaande uit ca. 25 medewerkers) is verantwoordelijk voor de vertaling van wet- en regelgeving naar de operationele IT-praktijk en draagt zorg voor het ontwikkelen en realiseren van zo optimaal mogelijke bedrijfs- en werkprocessen en ICT-ondersteuning voor de directie Handhaving. Tevens stelt de afdeling beleidsvoorstellen op, die gericht zijn op de bedrijfsinrichting. De afdeling vertaalt het directiebeleid naar het vakgebied informatiemanagement en adviseert de directie over innovatie in samenhang met de informatiehuishouding.

The internships or graduation project will allow you to learn how data science technology is applied in commercial and government organizations for mission critical applications and at the same time execute thorough scientific research.\n\nThe next internship/graduation project is available:\n\nProblem\n\n\u201cData is the new oil (or gold)\u201d. Recent progress in machine learning has shown exiting results in various text-mining applications such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), entity linking, but also in sentiment-, emotion-, and cynicism detection. Both traditional algorithms such as Support Vector Machines and Deep-learning models such as LSTM perform at levels well above human performance.\n\nThe solution to the above problems is no longer in the algorithms, but it is in the lack of (sufficient) annotated training data. Especially for less prevailing languages.\n\nManual creation of such data sets is too slow, too labor intensive and too expensive. In addition to this, human annotators are error prune, especially for the tedious and dreary work adding manual annotations. Sometimes, human annotations vary up to 40% for a given task.\n\nRecent research indicated that certain machine learning algorithms such as SVM are very robust against wrong training data. Experiments where deliberately up to 30% of wrong training data was added to the training set, show that the classifiers were still able to reach similar results as classifiers trained with perfect data, albeit only a bit slower.\n\nBased on these findings, this project focusses on creating such annotated training-data sets automatically. Various approaches exist already to do this:\n\nBootstrap a basic classifier with a small manually annotated data set and use this classifier to create larger data sets.\nUse links / annotations / structure from Wikipedia to create annotated data sets.\nUse Machine Translation to translate an annotated data set from one language to the other.\n\u2026\n\nCreating a reliable process, including support for development of multi-lingual data sets is the focus of this project.\n\nKey challenges\n\nKey challenges are to design and test such a process. What are the best methods to start? What are the minimal boot strapping data sets required? Can machine translation be used to translate data sets form one language to another? How do we prevent data sets to contain too much wrong data? How can we measure when a data set is too polluted? Etc.\n\nResearch Questions\n\nThe following research questions have to be answered in this project:\n\nHow robust are well known machine learning algorithms such as SVM, CNN or LSTM to wrong training data? Does it only delay the training process or does it also create a lower maximal performance?\nWhat are different methods and processes for (semi) automatic creation of data sets?\nHow good is the performance of such systems (in terms of precision, recall and F1-values)?\nHow can these methods be used to create data sets for other languages?\nWhat post and preprocessing methods can be used to increase the performance of the system?\n\nOther Expected / Desired Outcomes\n\nAt ZyLAB R&D, first a prototype is developed using a very basic approach to set a base line performance. Next, the objective is to use novel methods such as advanced machine learning methods (deep learning, better feature factories, better document representation methods, etc.) to create a better performing system.\n\nDevelopment Environment\n\nAt ZyLAB, develop is done in C# in combination with HTML-5 based on the Angular-6+ framework.\n\nData Sets\n\nZyLAB has several data sets to train and validate the performance of such systems. More information on other projects can be found here:\n\nhttps://textminingum.wordpress.com/\n\nCompensation\n\nDepending on your programming skills, ZyLAB will pay you an internship fee which is significant higher than what most other companies would pay you.

De breedte van onze dienstverlening en het maatschappelijke speelveld zorgen voor een veelzijdige en dynamische werkomgeving met veel aandacht voor persoonlijke ontplooiing.\n\nDe directie Handhaving richt zich op het bevorderen van het draagvlak voor de sociale zekerheid door naleving van wetten en regels te stimuleren. Zowel preventie als repressie dragen daar aan bij. Preventie beoogt te voorkomen dat klanten onbedoeld de regels overtreden. Repressie richt zich op de klanten die dat bewust doen. De directie Handhaving intensiveert haar activiteiten met betrekking tot het voeren van UWV-breed risicomanagement-handhaving. Als risico\u2019s op bewuste en onbewuste regelovertreding door de klant UWV-breed continu in beeld zijn, dan kunnen maatregelen worden getroffen om onbewuste regelovertreding beter te voorkomen en bewuste regelovertreding te bestrijden. Het doel daarvan is om een grotere mate van klantgerichtheid en rechtvaardigheid in de handhaving te verwezenlijken. Omdat er een verdergaande trend te zien is in de richting van complexe, grootschalige fraudevormen focust de directie Handhaving de komende jaren naast individuele gevalsbehandeling op thematisch gerichte onderzoeken. Daarnaast maakt Handhaving de komende jaren de beweging naar een meer data gedreven en risico-gerichte manier van werken.\n\nDe afdeling IM Handhaving valt onder de directie Handhaving. De eenheid (bestaande uit ca. 25 medewerkers) is verantwoordelijk voor de vertaling van wet- en regelgeving naar de operationele IT-praktijk en draagt zorg voor het ontwikkelen en realiseren van zo optimaal mogelijke bedrijfs- en werkprocessen en ICT-ondersteuning voor de directie Handhaving. Tevens stelt de afdeling beleidsvoorstellen op, die gericht zijn op de bedrijfsinrichting. De afdeling vertaalt het directiebeleid naar het vakgebied informatiemanagement en adviseert de directie over innovatie in samenhang met de informatiehuishouding. Wij werken steeds meer in multidisciplinaire teams.\n\n Kom je als procesontwerper bij ons werken, dan kies je voor een uitdagende omgeving en voor samenwerking met interessante disciplines.

We zoeken iemand voor dit bekende consultancybureau. Je krijgt hier volop begeleiding en veel verantwoordelijkheid, waardoor je je in korte tijd enorm kunt ontwikkelen.\nOver de opdrachtgever\nBij deze big4 is er, ondanks het volume van een paar duizend man, veel aandacht voor persoonlijke groei en ontwikkeling. De ambitie is om hun top 20-klanten in alles zo goed en optimaal mogelijk te kunnen bedienen vanuit advisory en daarom hebben jouw adviestrajecten vaak een multidisciplinair karakter. Daarnaast heeft dit bureau een uitgebreid netwerk van specialisten, zowel intern als extern, nationaal en internationaal.\nConsultants en mensen uit de business maakten de overstap naar deze big4 door onder meer het hoge niveau van opdrachten, het volledig kunnen richten op risk en compliance- in plaats van internal audit-vraagstukken of \u2013 vooral vanuit de business \u2013 omdat ze hier zeer diverse opdrachten bij verschillende opdrachtgevers kunnen doen.\nDe vacature valt binnen de consulting groep die klanten adviseert bij fusies en overnames, organisatieontwikkeling, performance improvement en crisismanagement. Het gaat om generiek risk management; alle invalshoeken van risk komen aan bod. Een creatieve geest is dus een must om tot goede oplossingen te komen.\nOver de functie\nWaar in de business risk en compliance nogal eens wordt ervaren als een obstakel, draait hier alles om de \u2018positieve benadering\u2019 van de bijbehorende vraagstukken. Je helpt bedrijven met groeidoelstellingen hun bedrijf in control te houden. Je richt bijvoorbeeld de governance in, zet een risk framework op of stimuleert ethisch en risicobewustzijn. Je geeft dus niet alleen advies, maar helpt de klant ook door het te implementeren en fysiek toe te passen. Teams bestaan daarom niet alleen uit je directe collega\u2019s, maar omvatten ook collega\u2019s uit andere practices (zoals HR en M&A).\nDe partners van deze afdeling zijn nauw betrokken bij hun medewerkers en vinden het belangrijk actief te blijven binnen de business. Hierdoor is er de mogelijkheid voor continue feedback. Je leercurve is dus groot. Hoewel je voornamelijk bij je klanten zit, staat hun deur altijd open om jou te helpen met klantvragen of persoonlijke dilemma\u2019s om jouw doelen te helpen realiseren.\nJe doet opdrachten bij diverse bedrijven, vaak meerdere naast elkaar, vari\u00ebrend van drie tot zes maanden of langer. Bovendien vloeien er uit een opdracht vaak vervolgopdrachten. Als (senior) manager manage jij (een deel van) het team om samen het einddoel te behalen. Je krijgt daarnaast alle ruimte voor andersoortige projecten, zoals het geven van trainingen, artikelen schrijven of bijvoorbeeld de recruitment van je team op te pakken.\nVoorbeeld van een opdracht:\nHet gehele risk- en controlframework opzetten voor een bekende retailer. Zij groeien zo hard dat het noodzakelijk is dat ze hierin goed worden begeleid. Dit is een voorbeeld waar onze opdrachtgever al meer dan een jaar mee bezig is en waar maar werk uit blijft voortkomen. Daarnaast neemt een andere afdeling binnen hetzelfde bureau het HR- en strategiestuk op zich, waardoor je ook nauw samenwerkt met die afdelingen.\nDe ideale kandidaat\nDe ideale kandidaat heeft 6-10 jaar ervaring in consultancy of in commerci\u00eble producten- of dienstensector. Bijv. industrial products, retail & consumer, telecommunicatie, energy, utilities & mining.\nJe hebt werkervaring op het snijvlak van strategie-executie, corporate governance en risico- en/of regulatory compliance management.\nJe hebt affiniteit met technologisch ontwikkelingen in dit werkveld.\nJe hebt ervaring met het (projectmatig) aansturen van teams.\nJe bent ondernemend, creatief, gepassioneerd, ambitieus en een teamwerker.\nJe werkt vanuit de visie dat je de klant wil helpen, want wat je doet heeft direct impact op het bedrijf.\nReden van de vacature\nDoor de langdurigere en uitgebreidere trajecten en verschuiving in accounting, is er meer werk dan de afdeling aankan. De practice groeit enorm. Hierdoor liggen er mooie kansen om jezelf te ontwikkelen.\nSollicitatieprocedure\nNa een gesprek bij Badenoch + Clark volgt een verkennend kennismakingsgesprek bij de opdrachtgever, daarna volgen nog twee gesprekken. Een assessment maakt onderdeel uit van de procedure.\nContact\nGe\u00efnteresseerd in deze functie? En pas je in het profiel?

Ruim 20.000 medewerkers in het hele land zetten zich dagelijks in om mensen aan het werk te helpen en te houden. We ondersteunen onze klanten in hun re-integratie en bij het vinden van een baan. Waar nodig voorzien wij hen van tijdelijk inkomen. Zo bieden we onze klanten nieuw perspectief op deelname aan de maatschappij. In totaal hebben we 1,5 miljoen klanten, die we snel en deskundig dienstverlening op maat bieden. De breedte van onze dienstverlening en het maatschappelijke speelveld zorgen voor een veelzijdige en dynamische werkomgeving met veel aandacht voor persoonlijke ontplooiing.\n\nDe directie Handhaving richt zich op het bevorderen van het draagvlak voor de sociale zekerheid door naleving van wetten en regels te stimuleren. Zowel preventie als repressie dragen daar aan bij. Preventie beoogt te voorkomen dat klanten onbedoeld de regels overtreden. Repressie richt zich op de klanten die dat bewust doen. De directie Handhaving intensiveert haar activiteiten met betrekking tot het voeren van UWV-breed risicomanagement-handhaving. Als risico\u2019s op bewuste en onbewuste regelovertreding door de klant UWV-breed continu in beeld zijn, dan kunnen maatregelen worden getroffen om onbewuste regelovertreding beter te voorkomen en bewuste regelovertreding te bestrijden. Het doel daarvan is om een grotere mate van klantgerichtheid en rechtvaardigheid in de handhaving te verwezenlijken. Omdat er een verdergaande trend te zien is in de richting van complexe, grootschalige fraudevormen focust de directie Handhaving de komende jaren naast individuele gevalsbehandeling op thematisch gerichte onderzoeken. Daarnaast maakt Handhaving de komende jaren de beweging naar een meer data gedreven en risico-gerichte manier van werken.\n\nDe afdeling IM Handhaving valt onder de directie Handhaving. De eenheid (bestaande uit ca. 25 medewerkers) is verantwoordelijk voor de vertaling van wet- en regelgeving naar de operationele IT-praktijk en draagt zorg voor het ontwikkelen en realiseren van zo optimaal mogelijke bedrijfs- en werkprocessen en ICT-ondersteuning voor de directie Handhaving. Tevens stelt de afdeling beleidsvoorstellen op, die gericht zijn op de bedrijfsinrichting. De afdeling vertaalt het directiebeleid naar het vakgebied informatiemanagement en adviseert de directie over innovatie in samenhang met de informatiehuishouding.

De directie Handhaving intensiveert haar activiteiten met betrekking tot het voeren van UWV-breed risicomanagement-handhaving. Als risico\u2019s op bewuste en onbewuste regelovertreding door de klant UWV-breed continu in beeld zijn, dan kunnen maatregelen worden getroffen om onbewuste regelovertreding beter te voorkomen en bewuste regelovertreding te bestrijden.

We zoeken iemand voor dit bekende consultancybureau. Je krijgt hier volop begeleiding en veel verantwoordelijkheid, waardoor je je in korte tijd enorm kunt ontwikkelen.\nOver de opdrachtgever\nBij deze big4 is er, ondanks het volume van een paar duizend man, veel aandacht voor persoonlijke groei en ontwikkeling. De ambitie is om hun top 20-klanten in alles zo goed en optimaal mogelijk te kunnen bedienen vanuit advisory en daarom hebben jouw adviestrajecten vaak een multidisciplinair karakter. Daarnaast heeft dit bureau een uitgebreid netwerk van specialisten, zowel intern als extern, nationaal en internationaal.\nConsultants en mensen uit de business maakten de overstap naar deze big4 door onder meer het hoge niveau van opdrachten, het volledig kunnen richten op risk en compliance- in plaats van internal audit-vraagstukken of \u2013 vooral vanuit de business \u2013 omdat ze hier zeer diverse opdrachten bij verschillende opdrachtgevers kunnen doen.\nDe vacature valt binnen de consulting groep die klanten adviseert bij fusies en overnames, organisatieontwikkeling, performance improvement en crisismanagement. Het gaat om generiek risk management; alle invalshoeken van risk komen aan bod. Een creatieve geest is dus een must om tot goede oplossingen te komen.\nOver de functie\nWaar in de business risk en compliance nogal eens wordt ervaren als een obstakel, draait hier alles om de \u2018positieve benadering\u2019 van de bijbehorende vraagstukken. Je helpt bedrijven met groeidoelstellingen hun bedrijf in control te houden. Je richt bijvoorbeeld de governance in, zet een risk framework op of stimuleert ethisch en risicobewustzijn. Je geeft dus niet alleen advies, maar helpt de klant ook door het te implementeren en fysiek toe te passen. Teams bestaan daarom niet alleen uit je directe collega\u2019s, maar omvatten ook collega\u2019s uit andere practices (zoals HR en M&A).\nDe partners van deze afdeling zijn nauw betrokken bij hun medewerkers en vinden het belangrijk actief te blijven binnen de business. Hierdoor is er de mogelijkheid voor continue feedback. Je leercurve is dus groot. Hoewel je voornamelijk bij je klanten zit, staat hun deur altijd open om jou te helpen met klantvragen of persoonlijke dilemma\u2019s om jouw doelen te helpen realiseren.\nJe doet opdrachten bij diverse bedrijven, vaak meerdere naast elkaar, vari\u00ebrend van drie tot zes maanden of langer. Bovendien vloeien er uit een opdracht vaak vervolgopdrachten. Als (senior) manager manage jij (een deel van) het team om samen het einddoel te behalen. Je krijgt daarnaast alle ruimte voor andersoortige projecten, zoals het geven van trainingen, artikelen schrijven of bijvoorbeeld de recruitment van je team op te pakken.\nVoorbeeld van een opdracht:\nHet gehele risk- en controlframework opzetten voor een bekende retailer. Zij groeien zo hard dat het noodzakelijk is dat ze hierin goed worden begeleid. Dit is een voorbeeld waar onze opdrachtgever al meer dan een jaar mee bezig is en waar maar werk uit blijft voortkomen. Daarnaast neemt een andere afdeling binnen hetzelfde bureau het HR- en strategiestuk op zich, waardoor je ook nauw samenwerkt met die afdelingen.\nDe ideale kandidaat\nDe ideale kandidaat heeft 6-10 jaar ervaring in consultancy of in commerci\u00eble producten- of dienstensector. Bijv. industrial products, retail & consumer, telecommunicatie, energy, utilities & mining.\nJe hebt werkervaring op het snijvlak van strategie-executie, corporate governance en risico- en/of regulatory compliance management.\nJe hebt affiniteit met technologisch ontwikkelingen in dit werkveld.\nJe hebt ervaring met het (projectmatig) aansturen van teams.\nJe bent ondernemend, creatief, gepassioneerd, ambitieus en een teamwerker.\nJe werkt vanuit de visie dat je de klant wil helpen, want wat je doet heeft direct impact op het bedrijf.\nReden van de vacature\nDoor de langdurigere en uitgebreidere trajecten en verschuiving in accounting, is er meer werk dan de afdeling aankan. De practice groeit enorm. Hierdoor liggen er mooie kansen om jezelf te ontwikkelen.\nSollicitatieprocedure\nNa een gesprek bij Badenoch + Clark volgt een verkennend kennismakingsgesprek bij de opdrachtgever, daarna volgen nog twee gesprekken. Een assessment maakt onderdeel uit van de procedure.\nContact\nGe\u00efnteresseerd in deze functie? En pas je in het profiel?
