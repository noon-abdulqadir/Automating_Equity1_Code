Organisatie
De tsunami van plasticsoep zo snel mogelijk stoppen! Dát is kort gezegd de missie van Plastic Soup Foundation. Lukt dat niet, dan zadelen we toekomstige generaties op met de gevolgen van een verschrikkelijke plaag. Plastic Soup Foundation is daarmee een ‘single issue’-milieuorganisatie. We houden ons met één ding bezig: het stoppen van de plasticvervuiling bij de bron. Om dat doel te bereiken leggen we graag de vinger op de zere plek, vooral bij de industrie en de overheid. Ook benadrukken we steeds meer de relatie tussen plastic en menselijke gezondheid, zoals met onze Plastic Health Summit en de campagnes op het terrein van microplastics en plasticafval. Educatie vormt vanzelfsprekend een belangrijke pijler van ons werk, want kinderen zijn de toekomst. De bron van die plasticvervuiling zijn we trouwens vaak zelf; de plasticsoep begint al voor je eigen deur op de stoep. We kunnen met z’n allen echt veel meer doen dan we geneigd zijn te denken!

Je zet social media krachtig en effectief in op dit thema en je identificeert kansen voor mediawerk
Je initieert en voert constructief-kritische gesprekken met bedrijven en overheden over het aanpassen van hun beleid en hun acties

Our programmes focus on the areas of health, education and livelihoods, with an increasing emphasis on resilience building, social accountability, gender and social inclusion. We believe progress is only possible when we work together and that strong partnerships are crucial to delivering positive change. Thats why we work with over 500 partner organisations, from local and national governments, to businesses, NGOs, funders, charities and community groups. Currently, over 30% of our people are recruited from within the country in which they work, and we continue to grow the share of community and national volunteers involved in our programmes. We also send increasing numbers of volunteers from one developing country to another. However, our vision has remained the same; to build a world without poverty.

Translate ideas and concepts into workable production schedules and budgets.
Work closely with our creative team and external partners throughout the production process, sharing your expertise and industry instincts.
Maintain sky-high standards across all of our in-house content.
Assist the Head of Production in managing schedules and budgets, assigning resources, and finding partners, directors, producers, and other vital talent to make the best creative work possible.
Coordinate the film and photography production process, making sure we have everything we need throughout the pre-production, shooting, post-production, and final delivery of content across all channels.
Motivating our global team of Bike Hunters to deliver the best content possible.
Coordinate the whole Bike Hunting content flow, from monitoring coordinates to facilitating hunts.
What you'll bring
At least 3 years experience in film and photography production.
A creative eye, with a practical understanding of what makes a good story and how to develop it.
Evidence of strong organizational skills.
Hand-on mentality – not afraid to get stuck in all aspects of production.
Great communication and problem-solving skills.
Flexibility – prepared to work irregular hours if needed.
The ability to work under pressure and adapt quickly to operational changes.
Excellent English skills, both written and spoken.
A valid EU driver’s license.
Based in the Netherlands and willing to commute in the Amsterdam area
What you'll get
26 paid holidays for you to unwind
Your very own VanMoof bike (lend-lease)
Laptop, screens, and software tools
Insider experience in a rapidly-growing international company
Healthy lunch provided when in the office
Special snacks, tasty coffee (and lots of tea) when in the office

Content marketing is all about telling a story that engages. That’s why we’re looking for a Content Specialist who knows how to tell a story about our leading brand JBL.

The role is a cross-divisional role between Consumer Audio (COA), and Professional Solutions (PRO), with emphasize on our Pro Solutions division and brands (e.g. JBL, AKG, Martin Lighting) situated in London, Apsley.

You will be planning, maintaining, monitoring and reporting on our PRO and COA social media channels and planning and maintaining web content with the global content team.
You will be translating business and marketing objectives into calendars, campaigns and content.
Staying updated on digital developments in the landscape relevant for your expertise.
Making data-driven digital analyses that drive decisions (ROI and ROAS).
Making understandable native and non-native reports of our digital plans and campaigns.
What You Need:
A bachelor’s or master’s degree in Marketing & Communication.
At least 3 years of working experience in digital marketing.
Understanding the basics of digital marketing and Social Media.
A second nature in analyzing digital media and actually doing it.
Ability of telling a digital brand story is what you live and breathe.
What is Nice to Have:
Experience in building and driving digital brand campaigns and plans.
Speaking more than one language; fluent English is a must.
What We Offer:
HARMAN offers a great work environment, challenging career opportunities, professional training and competitive market base compensation plus a 13th month salary, 28 holidays per year. You will also receive a highly valued commuter travel package, an interesting collective health insurance scheme, pension and top-notch employee discounts on Harman’s Consumer Audio products.
A unique opportunity to contribute to drive revenue growth and nurture strategic trust-based relationships.

Met deze kennis benader jij leveranciers op proactieve en creatieve wijze en overtuigt ze op basis van hun behoefte van de voordelen die samenwerking met Emesa voor hen met zich meebrengt.

Om nieuwe assortiment te sourcen, werk je vanuit kantoor, maar ben je ook onderweg naar leveranciers & beurzen in binnen- & buitenland (EU en China), zodra Corona het weer toelaat. Jouw onderhandeling skills en tactieken weet je zo in te zetten dat je altijd de beste deal voor onze klanten scoort, en daarbij een win-win situatie creëert voor Emesa en onze partners.

Je analyseert de resultaten en verwerkt deze met een toelichting in het slide deck voor de wekelijkse team meeting. Je merkt op dat enkele artikelen meer zijn verkocht dan verwacht, dus schakel je direct met je leverancier om te kijken of er nog voorraad beschikbaar is tegen de best mogelijke prijs.

Over 2 weken staat er een jaargesprek op de planning met jouw belangrijkste leverancier. Je begint aan de voorbereiding van de presentatie en spart met je manager over de te volgen strategie.

’s Middags heb je een kennismaking met een potentiële nieuwe leverancier, ditmaal via Microsoft Teams. Voordat je het gesprek in gaat, bereid jij je goed voor, zodat je gedegen het gesprek in gaat.

Daarna ga je aan de slag met de kwartaalplanning voor Q2, je werkt ver vooruit, omdat de fabriek in China tijd nodig heeft om jouw exclusieve productlijn te fabriceren en te versturen naar Nederland.
Voordat jij je laptop dichtklapt, check je samen met de category specialist welke promoties en activaties er aangaan komen en bepalen jullie het assortiment en de benodigde voorraad. Om 16:30 uur bel je via Teams in voor de wekelijkse (virtuele) Bootcamp les, zo begin je fit aan je werkweek.""

Research Institute / Consultants to conduct a Randomised Control Trial and qualitative analysis on the Aflateen+ Life Skills and Financial Education programme in Zimbabwe
From: Aflatoun International, Amsterdam
When: January 2021 – August 2023. The candidate should be available in February – April 2021 and December 2022 – February 2023.

Deadline for submitting proposals: Monday 25 January 2021


Background
Aflatoun International is a non-profit organization, which offers social and financial education to children and young people worldwide, empowering them to make a positive change for a more equitable world. Aflatoun creates high-quality curricula, for different age groups, which are contextualized to local needs and specific circumstances. In 2019, Aflatoun reached 10.5 million children in 108 countries through over 345 partner organizations.
Aflatoun programs inspire children to discover their talents and put them to use, to stand up for their rights and those of their communities, to play games, and to solve problems. They learn how to save, how to budget, and how to set up social and financial enterprises that benefit themselves, their families, and their communities.
Aflatoun has been identified as a best in practice organisation by The Brookings Institution in the report 'Can We Leapfrog? The Potential of Education Innovations to Rapidly Accelerate Progress’. The report presents a forward path in global education by examining the possibility of using innovations to ‘leapfrog’, rapidly accelerating educational progress to ensure that all young people develop the skills they need to thrive in a fast-changing world. Additionally, in 2019, HundrED Connect officially recognized Aflatoun as one of top 5 Spotlight Innovators for its work on financial education. HundrED Connect is an initiative that aims to improve education and inspire a movement by encouraging pedagogically sound and ambitious innovations to spread across the world. Aflatoun was also selected as an official Vanguard Member of the Million Lives Club, which celebrates innovators and social entrepreneurs who are reaching new horizons of impact and improving the lives of those living on less than $5 a day, and who have already scaled to serve at least 1,000,000 people.


Project information
While significant progress has been made towards universal primary school attendance, the reality is that a third (34%) of children of lower secondary school age (12-14 years) and more than half (58%) of 15 to 17-year-olds in sub-Saharan Africa are not in school. Hence, majority of those who should be acquiring the skills to prepare them for the job market, or move into further education, are not in the classroom, making it less likely that they will have a positive impact on their countries’ development.
Improving youth’s future prospects for decent work helps break the intergenerational cycle of poverty and is beneficial for entire communities. To do so, it is crucial that adolescents understand money, resources and the markets that increasingly affect them, as they become consumers, workers and active citizens. This greatly improves their prospects for the future, as it prepares young people for a complex and turbulent job market.

In this context, Aflatoun will roll out its Aflateen+ programme in Zimbabwe through its partnership with implementing organization Junior Achievement Zimbabwe. Junior Achievement Zimbabwe is a not-for-profit organization aiming to prepare and inspire young people to value free enterprise, business, economics and entrepreneurship.
Aflateen+ is a comprehensive educational programme to transform the lives of adolescent girls and boys aged 14-19 through social and financial education, and entrepreneurship with a gender lens. The programme’s biggest strength is its flexibility to adapt to the local needs of the girls and boys, while offering a variety of lessons on life skills, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and financial empowerment. Throughout the lessons, the connection between gender equality and economic prosperity is emphasized. The project’s overall objective is
To socially and economically empower young girls and boys (ages of 14 to 19) in Zimbabwe by providing them with the social and financial skills necessary to make informed choices about their health, financial situation, and education.


Impact assessment

To assess the impact of the Aflateen+ programme on adolescent girls and boys in Zimbabwe, this research will use a mixed-method approach, with a heavy quantitative component. The study will collect and evaluate quantitative data through a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) and qualitative data from e.g. Most Significant Change or Focus Group Discussions.
The main question of the research is: What is the effect of the Aflateen+ programme among participants of the Aflateen+ programme, relative to the representative control sample in Zimbabwe?
Since the project runs over three years, we aim to not only measure knowledge, awareness and attitudes of adolescent girls and boys, but also assess the impact of the programme on SDG outcome and impact indicators like school retention/attendance/drop-out, teenage pregnancy, gender based violence, and HIV-risk behaviour.


Capacity assessment
In order to assess the effectiveness of the capacity building component of the project, the research will include two tools assessing the capacity of both trained partners/NGOs, as well as trained teachers/educators.
Adding to that, as a follow up to the training of teachers, weekly push messages will be sent to the teachers or trainers via SMS or social media platforms. These messages may be questions or surveys on the progress of Aflateen+ activities. Additionally, micro content that reinforces learning, or guides teaching activities will be shared.
The evidence generated through this study will assist in regional advocacy and Aflatoun’s engagement with regional bodies like SADC and the African Union, which will contribute to our efforts towards education system change.

Research Institute / Consultants to conduct a Randomised Control Trial and qualitative analysis on the Aflateen+ Life Skills and Financial Education programme in Mozambique

From: Aflatoun International, Amsterdam

When: January 2021 – August 2023. The candidate should be available in February – April 2021 and December 2022 – February 2023.
Deadline for submitting proposals: Monday 25 January 2021


Background

Aflatoun International is a non-profit organization, which offers social and financial education to children and young people worldwide, empowering them to make a positive change for a more equitable world. Aflatoun creates high-quality curricula, for different age groups, which are contextualized to local needs and specific circumstances. In 2019, Aflatoun reached 10.5 million children in 108 countries through over 345 partner organizations.
Aflatoun programs inspire children to discover their talents and put them to use, to stand up for their rights and those of their communities, to play games, and to solve problems. They learn how to save, how to budget, and how to set up social and financial enterprises that benefit themselves, their families, and their communities.
Aflatoun has been identified as a best in practice organisation by The Brookings Institution in the report 'Can We Leapfrog? The Potential of Education Innovations to Rapidly Accelerate Progress’. The report presents a forward path in global education by examining the possibility of using innovations to ‘leapfrog’, rapidly accelerating educational progress to ensure that all young people develop the skills they need to thrive in a fast-changing world. Additionally, in 2019, HundrED Connect officially recognized Aflatoun as one of top 5 Spotlight Innovators for its work on financial education. HundrED Connect is an initiative that aims to improve education and inspire a movement by encouraging pedagogically sound and ambitious innovations to spread across the world. Aflatoun was also selected as an official Vanguard Member of the Million Lives Club, which celebrates innovators and social entrepreneurs who are reaching new horizons of impact and improving the lives of those living on less than $5 a day, and who have already scaled to serve at least 1,000,000 people.


Project information

While significant progress has been made towards universal primary school attendance, the reality is that a third (34%) of children of lower secondary school age (12-14 years) and more than half (58%) of 15 to 17-year-olds in sub-Saharan Africa are not in school. Hence, majority of those who should be acquiring the skills to prepare them for the job market, or move into further education, are not in the classroom, making it less likely that they will have a positive impact on their countries’ development.
Improving youth’s future prospects for decent work helps break the intergenerational cycle of poverty and is beneficial for entire communities. To do so, it is crucial that adolescents understand money, resources and the markets that increasingly affect them, as they become consumers, workers and active citizens. This greatly improves their prospects for the future, as it prepares young people for a complex and turbulent job market.

this context, Aflatoun will roll out its Aflateen+ programme in Mozambique through its partnership with implementing organization Wona Sanana (WS).
Wona Sanana (WS) is a Mozambique-based organization dedicated to Child Protection and Education through providing technical assistance to local actors focusing on youth and education, and through advocating for the involvement of government agencies to ensure inclusive education and child protection policies.
Aflateen+ is a comprehensive educational programme to transform the lives of adolescent girls and boys aged 14-19 through social and financial education, and entrepreneurship with a gender lens. The programme’s biggest strength is its flexibility to adapt to the local needs of the girls and boys, while offering a variety of lessons on life skills, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and financial empowerment. Throughout the lessons, the connection between gender equality and economic prosperity is emphasized. The project’s overall objective is
To socially and economically empower young girls and boys (ages of 14 to 19) in Mozambique by providing them with the social and financial skills necessary to make informed choices about their health, financial situation, and education.


Impact assessment

To assess the impact of the Aflateen+ programme on adolescent girls and boys in Mozambique, this research will use a mixed-method approach, with a heavy quantitative component. The study will collect and evaluate quantitative data through a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) and qualitative data from e.g. Most Significant Change or Focus Group Discussions.
The main question of the research is: What is the effect of the Aflateen+ programme among participants of the Aflateen+ programme, relative to the representative control sample in Mozambique?
Since the project runs over three years, we aim to not only measure knowledge, awareness and attitudes of adolescent girls and boys, but also assess the impact of the programme on SDG outcome and impact indicators like school retention/attendance/drop-out, teenage pregnancy, gender based violence, and HIV-risk behaviour.


Capacity assessment

In order to assess the effectiveness of the capacity building component of the project, the research will include two tools assessing the capacity of both trained partners/NGOs, as well as trained teachers/educators.
Adding to that, as a follow up to the training of teachers, weekly push messages will be sent to the teachers or trainers via SMS or social media platforms. These messages may be questions or surveys on the progress of Aflateen+ activities. Additionally, micro content that reinforces learning, or guides teaching activities will be shared.
The evidence generated through this study will assist in regional advocacy and Aflatoun’s engagement with regional bodies like SADC and the African Union, which will contribute to our efforts towards education system change.

In January 2020, Philips announced that it would be considering new ownership options for Domestic Appliances, as it is not a strategic fit for the company’s future as a health technology leader, and committed to finding the right home for the business to ensure that it is set up for continued success serving customers, leveraging the Philips brand and driving growth across the markets that it serves.
In its 128-year history as a leading innovator, Philips has had to reinvent itself a number of times to remain competitive. This has involved several high-profile divestments, resulting in the company’s successful track record in managing complex change of this scale. Such transformations offer unique opportunities for employees to ‘make their mark’ and gain expertise in a specific and dynamic environment - those who can deliver results while navigating and contributing to changes will gain unique skills and perspective that will prove valuable for the rest of their careers.
