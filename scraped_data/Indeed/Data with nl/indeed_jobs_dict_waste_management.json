Your role will involve building relationships and coalitions in the Netherlands, at EU level and in Member States, drawing learning from Feedback's UK campaigning on meat, diets and supermarkets, and developing and implementing a campaign plan for the Dutch context. For the right candidate, there will be significant opportunities for development and leadership of Feedback's work in Europe.

We are transforming the way the world eats by making food more convenient and accessible. We give people the opportunity to eat what they want, when and where they want it.\n\nOur journey began with our founder Will, arriving in London and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite living in one of the world's best cities for food. In 2013 he got on his bike and founded Deliveroo.\n\nFast forward to today and Deliveroo can be found in 12 markets, with over 110,000 riders delivering orders from over 140,000 restaurants and grocery stores serving millions of customers in 800 worldwide.\n\nDelivering great food from restaurants is how we started, but isn't our only offering. We pioneered the delivery-only kitchen model, Deliveroo Editions, where we use data to identify gaps in the market and bring new brands and cuisines to new areas, giving people more choice in their local neighbourhood. And using our network and technology we provide a growing on-demand grocery service, which has not only brought incredible levels of convenience to our customers but has been a lifeline to so many during COVID.\n\nWe operate one of the most complex three sided marketplaces, and we do this in real-time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds, and the algorithms behind our marketplace are the secret sauce that allow us to deliver our orders in under 30 minutes.\n\nThere are so many questions we are working on and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do we give low income families access to affordable healthy meals? How do we tackle waste? How can we scale our network to tens of millions of orders a day? What does a future layout of a restaurant look like? How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we take what we know about a customer and offer a truly personalised selection?\n\nAt Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous. We are still a small team, making a very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.\n\nThe size of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. Only 3% of the global food market is online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of other industries, such as from travel (45%) and retail (10%), and it is clear we are at the very beginning of our journey. Despite being one of the world's fastest growing multi-billion dollar companies, we're only just getting started.\n\nWe hope you're as excited about the scale of the opportunity as we are and, if you share our ambition, that you'll join us and be part of this incredible story.\n\n\nResponsibilities & Requirements\n\nThe successful candidate would be expected to lead and execute on Deliveroo's corporate affairs priorities in the Netherlands.

We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and we're very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.\n\nThere are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered.

At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.\n\n\nBenefits and Diversity\n\nAt Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.\n\nIn 2018 we announced our decision to give every employee equity in the company. We did this because we wanted all of our employees, regardless of location, level or role to be owners and because we believe that this is the right thing to do.

We are transforming the way the world eats by making food more convenient and accessible. We give people the opportunity to eat what they want, when and where they want it.\n\nOur journey began with our founder Will, arriving in London and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite living in one of the world's best cities for food. In 2013 he got on his bike and founded Deliveroo.\n\nFast forward to today and Deliveroo can be found in 12 markets, with over 110,000 riders delivering orders from over 140,000 restaurants and grocery stores serving millions of customers in 800 worldwide.\n\nDelivering great food from restaurants is how we started, but isn't our only offering. We pioneered the delivery-only kitchen model, Deliveroo Editions, where we use data to identify gaps in the market and bring new brands and cuisines to new areas, giving people more choice in their local neighbourhood. And using our network and technology we provide a growing on-demand grocery service, which has not only brought incredible levels of convenience to our customers but has been a lifeline to so many during COVID.\n\nWe operate one of the most complex three sided marketplaces, and we do this in real-time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds, and the algorithms behind our marketplace are the secret sauce that allow us to deliver our orders in under 30 minutes.\n\nThere are so many questions we are working on and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do we give low income families access to affordable healthy meals? How do we tackle waste? How can we scale our network to tens of millions of orders a day?

How can we take what we know about a customer and offer a truly personalised selection?\n\nAt Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours.

We are transforming the way the world eats by making food more convenient and accessible. We give people the opportunity to eat what they want, when and where they want it.\n\nOur journey began with our founder Will, arriving in London and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite living in one of the world's best cities for food. In 2013 he got on his bike and founded Deliveroo.\n\nFast forward to today and Deliveroo can be found in 12 markets, with over 110,000 riders delivering orders from over 140,000 restaurants and grocery stores serving millions of customers in 800 worldwide.\n\nDelivering great food from restaurants is how we started, but isn't our only offering. We pioneered the delivery-only kitchen model, Deliveroo Editions, where we use data to identify gaps in the market and bring new brands and cuisines to new areas, giving people more choice in their local neighbourhood. And using our network and technology we provide a growing on-demand grocery service, which has not only brought incredible levels of convenience to our customers but has been a lifeline to so many during COVID.\n\nWe operate one of the most complex three sided marketplaces, and we do this in real-time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds, and the algorithms behind our marketplace are the secret sauce that allow us to deliver our orders in under 30 minutes.\n\nThere are so many questions we are working on and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do we give low income families access to affordable healthy meals? How do we tackle waste? How can we scale our network to tens of millions of orders a day? What does a future layout of a restaurant look like? How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we take what we know about a customer and offer a truly personalised selection?\n\nAt Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous. We are still a small team, making a very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.\n\nThe size of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. Only 3% of the global food market is online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of other industries, such as from travel (45%) and retail (10%), and it is clear we are at the very beginning of our journey. Despite being one of the world's fastest growing multi-billion dollar companies, we're only just getting started.\n\nWe hope you're as excited about the scale of the opportunity as we are and, if you share our ambition, that you'll join us and be part of this incredible story.\n\n\nResponsibilities & Requirements\n\nThe successful candidate would be expected to lead and execute on Deliveroo's corporate affairs priorities in the Netherlands. This would involve both public affairs and corporate communications. You will therefore need to have both the judgement to decide on priorities and the dynamic hunger to deliver against them.\n\nYou would report to Deliveroo's global policy and communications team in London. You would also work closely with Deliveroo's General Manager in the Netherlands, as well as other senior figures in both Amsterdam and London.\n\nAs part of your job, you would ensure:\n\nthat Deliveroo is generating a stream of proactive and creative media opportunities in the Netherlands;\nThat the business responds to risks and opportunities arising from public affairs and regulatory issues in market;\nthe company is proactive in dealing with challenges, in communicating our business model and policy positions, and in demonstrating our commitment to the communities in which we operate;\n\nImportant competencies for the successful candidate will include:\n\nSeveral years experience in fields relating to Dutch media and politics - a combination of both would be highly valued;\nStrong pre-existing relationships and network that could be used for both corporate communications and public affairs;\nAn understanding of the policy and regulatory issues facing companies in the gig economy.\n\nA proactive attitude and a desire to learn about and help make decisions right across the business, including commercial and operational decisions.\n\nA desire to work in a close-knit team and across multiple teams in a growing organisation, in particular policy, legal, finance and operations.\n\nAn excellent verbal and written communicator with the ability to prioritise.\nFluency in both Dutch and English.\n\n\nLife at Deliveroo\n\nWe are a growing team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and we're very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.\n\nThere are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered.

At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.\n\n\nBenefits and Diversity\n\nAt Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.\n\nIn 2018 we announced our decision to give every employee equity in the company. We did this because we wanted all of our employees, regardless of location, level or role to be owners and because we believe that this is the right thing to do. We believe this helps build a culture where everyone is committed and able to share in the company's success.\n\nWe believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander.

In 2013 he got on his bike and founded Deliveroo.\n\nFast forward to today and Deliveroo can be found in 12 markets, with over 110,000 riders delivering orders from over 140,000 restaurants and grocery stores serving millions of customers in 800 worldwide.\n\nDelivering great food from restaurants is how we started, but isn't our only offering. We pioneered the delivery-only kitchen model, Deliveroo Editions, where we use data to identify gaps in the market and bring new brands and cuisines to new areas, giving people more choice in their local neighbourhood. And using our network and technology we provide a growing on-demand grocery service, which has not only brought incredible levels of convenience to our customers but has been a lifeline to so many during COVID.\n\nWe operate one of the most complex three sided marketplaces, and we do this in real-time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds, and the algorithms behind our marketplace are the secret sauce that allow us to deliver our orders in under 30 minutes.\n\nThere are so many questions we are working on and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do we give low income families access to affordable healthy meals? How do we tackle waste? How can we scale our network to tens of millions of orders a day? What does a future layout of a restaurant look like? How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we take what we know about a customer and offer a truly personalised selection?\n\nAt Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous. We are still a small team, making a very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.\n\nThe size of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. Only 3% of the global food market is online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of other industries, such as from travel (45%) and retail (10%), and it is clear we are at the very beginning of our journey. Despite being one of the world's fastest growing multi-billion dollar companies, we're only just getting started.\n\nWe hope you're as excited about the scale of the opportunity as we are and, if you share our ambition, that you'll join us and be part of this incredible story.\n\n\nResponsibilities & Requirements\n\nThe successful candidate would be expected to lead and execute on Deliveroo's corporate affairs priorities in the Netherlands.

We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and we're very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.\n\nThere are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered.

You must possess the right to work in the EU.About UsFeedback is a London-based environmental campaign group. We work to regenerate nature by transforming our food system. Food production is the single greatest impact humans have on the environment. From mountains of food waste, to habitat destruction to grow animal feed for factory farms, to soil depletion leaving future harvests at risk: the food system needs to change. Founded in 2013, we combine investigative research, campaigns, community outreach and on-the-ground pilot projects for a better food system.About the roleThis is an exciting and unique opportunity to bring Feedback's pioneering campaigning on sustainable diets and supermarkets to a new European context. We are seeking a senior campaigner to manage our program of work on meat, diets and climate change in the Netherlands. Based in Amsterdam, or another location in the Netherlands, subject to discussion, the successful candidate will also be Feedback's first EU-based employee, building on our history of campaigning across the EU and in Member States on food and environment issues.We're looking for a self-starter who is able to work independently and take the initiative, to work closely with Feedback's existing staff in London, to launch and manage a program of campaigning to ensure that the private sector, in particular supermarkets, play a central role in halving public meat and dairy consumption by 2030. Your role will involve building relationships and coalitions in the Netherlands, at EU level and in Member States, drawing learning from Feedback's UK campaigning on meat, diets and supermarkets, and developing and implementing a campaign plan for the Dutch context. For the right candidate, there will be significant opportunities for development and leadership of Feedback's work in Europe. Feedback is in the process of setting up a foundation in the Netherlands as our long-term EU base. The successful candidate will initially be employed by our ally Stichting Changing Markets for the first six months, but line managed by Feedback through a secondment arrangement. The 1 month probationary period of this first phase will count as full probationary period and would not need to be repeated when the contract is switched to Feedback. Feedback is currently in the process of formalizing its presence as a registered charity (Stichting) in the NetherlandsIn the short-term, while this process is underway, the successful candidate will be contracted by Changing Markets Foundation, close allies of Feedback. After the initial 6-month contract via Changing Markets, the employee will transfer to a contract with Feedback.To be successful in this role, you will need to be passionate about addressing head-on the damage that our food system causes to our climate, ecology and biodiversity. You will be an experienced campaigner, with a strong understanding of the environmental and climate sector in the Netherlands and a good grasp of the interactions between food systems and environmental issues.

We always use field-fresh high-quality flowers straight from the grower and deliver to our customers through a high-tech and highly creative platform. Our e-commerce company launched in Amsterdam in 2014 and went from start-up to scale-up at hypersonic speed. We are already active in five countries: the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, UK, and Denmark. Next step? To conquer Europe\u2026 and then the world. Our goal? To become the first global flower brand in the lifestyle segment, filling hearts and homes with happiness. One bouquet at a time.\nSupply & Demand Planning at bloomon\nbloomon has grown to its current size with a business model based around subscription customers - this means that we have been able to buy our flowers and produce our bouquets according to the direct order schedule of our customers, and did not have to do a lot of forecasting.

Aan jou de taak om met voorstellen te komen hoe het proces stabieler (met minder storingen/downtime) kan operereren. Deze voorstellen kunnen leiden tot ombouwprojecten en mogelijk grote investeringen waarvan jij de trekker zal zijn. Zoals altijd moet er een goede balans zijn tussen de productie en het onderhoud. Aan jou de uitdaging om, op een plezierige doch strak georganiseerde wijze, de samenwerking met de productieafdeling op te zetten en in te vullen.\n\nVastleggen en structureren\nJij gaat aan de slag met het cre\u00ebren van overzicht en duidelijkheid door structuren, processen en werkwijzen in kaart te brengen, te optimaliseren en vast te leggen. Onderhoudsprocessen maak je visueel, de administratieve handelingen meer gestructureerd en overzichtelijker en planningen worden geoptimaliseerd. Je zorgt dat je verbinding maakt met de medewerkers, hen betrekt bij de verbeterplannen en draagvlak cre\u00ebert waarbij heldere communicatie voorop staat. Ook leg je scheidingen van taken en verantwoordelijkheden vast en begeleidt en coach je medewerkers bij hun werk.\n\nKortom: door jouw proactieve en gestructureerde manier van werken, ontstaat een goed georganiseerde onderhoudsorganisatie met overzicht en rust met als gevolg daarvan meer effici\u00ebntie en werkplezier!\n\nStandplaats: Assendelft\nWat ga je doen?\nVacature\nWat is vereist?\nAfgeronde MTS / HTS-opleiding;\nErvaring met de toegepaste technieken zoals pompen, hydrocyclonage, natte zeeftechnieken, transportbanden, feeders, metaalterugwinning, indikkers, ontwateringstechnologie en fysisch/chemische waterzuivering;\nErvaring met het aansturen van een technische dienst;\nWoonachtig in Noord Holland;\n\nPersoonskenmerken\nJe bent een people manager die met energie en enthousiasme anderen motiveert en tegelijkertijd structuur weet aan te brengen en helder communiceert. Je houdt van de combinatie van theorie en praktijk en staat zelf ook graag \u201cmet je voeten in de klei\u201d.\n\nDoor je brede technische kennis ben je in staat de complexe processen binnen de installaties te doorgronden en eigen te maken. Na de uitgebreide inwerkperiode heb je de potentie en interesse uit te groeien tot de technisch expert van de installatie.\n\nOver alle details, informatiestromen, betrokken partijen en belangen weet jij het overzicht te houden en kom je tot realistische planningen. Je bent in staat processen in te richten en te bewaken. Hierbij ben je proactief en zorg je dat zaken soepel verlopen waarbij ruimte is te anticiperen op onverwachte situaties.\n\nJe maakt graag verbinding met mensen, weet het beste in anderen naar boven te halen, bent toegankelijk, betrouwbaar en voorspelbaar \u2018omdat je zegt wat je doet en doet wat je zegt\u2019. Je werkt graag samen met anderen en bent je ervan bewust dat je andere nodig hebt om \u2018de klus te klaren\u2019.

Nee, we zien nieuwe kansen. We zien materialen om gebouwen mee te bouwen, snelwegen en bestrating aan te leggen. We zien metalen voor nieuwe auto\u2019s, computers en mobiele telefoons. En we zien een toekomst waarin waste-to-energy volledig circulair is.\n\nBij Blue Phoenix Group zijn we ervan overtuigd dat er niet zoiets bestaat als afval. Met een gepassioneerd team helpen we wereldwijd waste-to-energy bedrijven om te recyclen wat onmogelijk te recyclen lijkt te zijn. We staan niet alleen in deze missie en bundelen krachten waar we dat kunnen. We werken nauw samen met fabrieken, makers van overheidsbeleid, toezichthouders, engineers en wetenschappers.

We are transforming the way the world eats by making food more convenient and accessible. We give people the opportunity to eat what they want, when and where they want it.\n\nOur journey began with our founder Will, arriving in London and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite living in one of the world's best cities for food. In 2013 he got on his bike and founded Deliveroo.\n\nFast forward to today and Deliveroo can be found in 12 markets, with over 110,000 riders delivering orders from over 140,000 restaurants and grocery stores serving millions of customers in 800 worldwide.\n\nDelivering great food from restaurants is how we started, but isn't our only offering. We pioneered the delivery-only kitchen model, Deliveroo Editions, where we use data to identify gaps in the market and bring new brands and cuisines to new areas, giving people more choice in their local neighbourhood. And using our network and technology we provide a growing on-demand grocery service, which has not only brought incredible levels of convenience to our customers but has been a lifeline to so many during COVID.\n\nWe operate one of the most complex three sided marketplaces, and we do this in real-time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds, and the algorithms behind our marketplace are the secret sauce that allow us to deliver our orders in under 30 minutes.\n\nThere are so many questions we are working on and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do we give low income families access to affordable healthy meals? How do we tackle waste? How can we scale our network to tens of millions of orders a day? What does a future layout of a restaurant look like? How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we take what we know about a customer and offer a truly personalised selection?\n\nAt Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous. We are still a small team, making a very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.\n\nThe size of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. Only 3% of the global food market is online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of other industries, such as from travel (45%) and retail (10%), and it is clear we are at the very beginning of our journey. Despite being one of the world's fastest growing multi-billion dollar companies, we're only just getting started.\n\nWe hope you're as excited about the scale of the opportunity as we are and, if you share our ambition, that you'll join us and be part of this incredible story.\n\n\nResponsibilities & Requirements\n\nThe successful candidate would be expected to lead and execute on Deliveroo's corporate affairs priorities in the Netherlands. This would involve both public affairs and corporate communications. You will therefore need to have both the judgement to decide on priorities and the dynamic hunger to deliver against them.\n\nYou would report to Deliveroo's global policy and communications team in London. You would also work closely with Deliveroo's General Manager in the Netherlands, as well as other senior figures in both Amsterdam and London.\n\nAs part of your job, you would ensure:\n\nthat Deliveroo is generating a stream of proactive and creative media opportunities in the Netherlands;\nThat the business responds to risks and opportunities arising from public affairs and regulatory issues in market;\nthe company is proactive in dealing with challenges, in communicating our business model and policy positions, and in demonstrating our commitment to the communities in which we operate;\n\nImportant competencies for the successful candidate will include:\n\nSeveral years experience in fields relating to Dutch media and politics - a combination of both would be highly valued;\nStrong pre-existing relationships and network that could be used for both corporate communications and public affairs;\nAn understanding of the policy and regulatory issues facing companies in the gig economy.\n\nA proactive attitude and a desire to learn about and help make decisions right across the business, including commercial and operational decisions.\n\nA desire to work in a close-knit team and across multiple teams in a growing organisation, in particular policy, legal, finance and operations.\n\nAn excellent verbal and written communicator with the ability to prioritise.\nFluency in both Dutch and English.\n\n\nLife at Deliveroo\n\nWe are a growing team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and we're very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.\n\nThere are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered.

At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.\n\n\nBenefits and Diversity\n\nAt Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.\n\nIn 2018 we announced our decision to give every employee equity in the company. We did this because we wanted all of our employees, regardless of location, level or role to be owners and because we believe that this is the right thing to do. We believe this helps build a culture where everyone is committed and able to share in the company's success.\n\nWe believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander.

In 2013 he got on his bike and founded Deliveroo.\n\nFast forward to today and Deliveroo can be found in 12 markets, with over 110,000 riders delivering orders from over 140,000 restaurants and grocery stores serving millions of customers in 800 worldwide.\n\nDelivering great food from restaurants is how we started, but isn't our only offering. We pioneered the delivery-only kitchen model, Deliveroo Editions, where we use data to identify gaps in the market and bring new brands and cuisines to new areas, giving people more choice in their local neighbourhood. And using our network and technology we provide a growing on-demand grocery service, which has not only brought incredible levels of convenience to our customers but has been a lifeline to so many during COVID.\n\nWe operate one of the most complex three sided marketplaces, and we do this in real-time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds, and the algorithms behind our marketplace are the secret sauce that allow us to deliver our orders in under 30 minutes.\n\nThere are so many questions we are working on and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do we give low income families access to affordable healthy meals? How do we tackle waste? How can we scale our network to tens of millions of orders a day? What does a future layout of a restaurant look like? How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we take what we know about a customer and offer a truly personalised selection?\n\nAt Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous. We are still a small team, making a very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, value autonomy and ownership, and we are always looking for new ideas.\n\nThe size of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. Only 3% of the global food market is online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of other industries, such as from travel (45%) and retail (10%), and it is clear we are at the very beginning of our journey. Despite being one of the world's fastest growing multi-billion dollar companies, we're only just getting started.\n\nWe hope you're as excited about the scale of the opportunity as we are and, if you share our ambition, that you'll join us and be part of this incredible story.\n\n\nResponsibilities & Requirements\n\nThe successful candidate would be expected to lead and execute on Deliveroo's corporate affairs priorities in the Netherlands.

We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and we're very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.\n\nThere are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered.
