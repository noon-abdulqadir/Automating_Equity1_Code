Our changed name also enhances our alignment to Microsoft's full technology portfolio and Microsoft’s overall Digital Transformation messaging.
How MSM helps
A lot of customers are not successful in or dissatisfied with their IT transformation. Usually not because of the technology falling short, but because of failure to adapt their people responsibilities, process flows and governance models. MSM addresses those components for cloud and other leading-edge transformations (Security, AI, etc.).

Our services remove operational blockers, accelerate cloud adoption and make the customer IT team a Microsoft advocate by enabling them to effectively plan, operate and control their modernized IT Services.

Your main goal will be to enable our customers to achieve business value through accelerated Cloud adoption, Digital transformation and productive use of Microsoft services and technologies aligned to our Cloud Strategy.
This is by nature a very independent role where you work and constantly learn in a in larger geographically dispersed team. Traits are: hold your own at the customer, seek out new initiatives, build on other people’s work, be creative and have fun.
Key Accountabilities
Success for an MSM customer engineer is measured by: overall customer satisfaction on the delivered service and how it was delivered; how you helped raise internal awareness of our MSM services but also if you spotted or even created opportunities to help customers do more with our MSM services. As with any Customer Engineering role, achievement of the expected utilization target is key to success.
