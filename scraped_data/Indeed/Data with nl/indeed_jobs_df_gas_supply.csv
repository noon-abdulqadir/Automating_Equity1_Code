Vacaturenummer 21-113

Are you a highly motivated student who likes performing state-of-the-art atomic physics experiments as well as numerical simulations? Then we are looking for you.
The hybrid atom-ion Quantum Systems lab, headed by Dr Rene Gerritsma, is part of the Quantum Gases and Quantum Information (QGQI) cluster at the University of Amsterdam (UvA). The main focus of the group is to study the quantum dynamics in trapped ions while at the same time developing technology for emerging quantum applications, such as quantum computing and simulation. Dr Arghavan Safavi-Naini has recently joined the Institute of Physics (IoP) at the University of Amsterdam and is part of the QuSoft initiative.
What are you going to do?
You will work in a team that develops a new quantum simulation and computation platform: trapped ions that are pinned by optical microtraps. We aim to use this system as a programmable quantum simulator for quantum many-body dynamics and quantum computation applications. Your project will center on investigation of the role of interaction range, connectivity, and dimensionality in transport and entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems both theoretically and experimentally. The project will consist of several interrelated sub-projects that aim to answer the following questions:
What is the functional form of equilibration in systems with long-range vs short-range interactions?
What is the appropriate controlled approximation that captures the transport dynamics in higher dimensional systems?
What is the most experimentally accessible way to create flexible connectivity and create patterns of interest?

In order to explore these topics you will develop state of the art numerical methods based on Matrix Product States (MPS) and Tensor networks. This will allow you to address questions 1 and 2. You will then use both the exact numerics, as well as the approximate techniques, to address question 1 for a variety of connectivity patterns and dimensionality, including 2D triangular lattices, the Bethe lattice, and models such as the SYK model. The methods you develop here will have very broad applications and have the potential to allow for numerical simulation of systems where even the current best exact methods cannot address.
Once we have characterized the behavior of our models theoretically, you will shift your attention to implementing them on the quantum simulation platform. The successful realization of the aforementioned models will be a significant progress in the level of programmability of the trapped ion quantum simulation platforms and on of the first experimental realizations of paradigmatic models such as the SYK model. You will work in a team of two PhD students and a post doc with the aim of implementing quantum simulation models in a trapped ion quantum simulator that is operated in our lab. The work will involve setting up optics, lasers and electronics as well as programming. We will focus in particular on implementing optical forces on the ion crystal that cause local stress or strain on the crystal and use these to further tune the interactions between the ions.
Relevant references:
R. Nath et al., New J. Phys. 17, 065018 (2015)
Zhang et al., Nature 551, 601 (2017)
What do we require?
We require a MSc. in (theoretical or experimental) Physics or Physical Chemistry and you are requested to motivate why you apply for the position and to supply a CV.
Other skills/experiences/documents that would benefit your application are:
previous laboratory experience in an atomic physics lab;
solid programming skills (in Python, MATLAB, or equivalent) and previous experience in a numerical project;
excellent communication skills (English);
scientific publications.

To foster diversity in our research group, we will especially appreciate applications from female candidates.
Our offer
We offer a temporary contract for 38 hours per week for the duration of 4 years (the initial contract will be for a period of 18 months and after satisfactory evaluation it will be extended for a total duration of 4 years). This should lead to a dissertation (PhD thesis). We will draft an educational plan that includes attendance of courses and (international) meetings. We also expect you to assist in teaching undergraduates and Master students.
The salary, depending on relevant experience before the beginning of the employment contract, will be €2,395 to €3,061 (scale P) gross per month, based on a full-time contract of 38 hours a week. This is exclusive 8% holiday allowance and 8.3% end-of-year bonus. A favourable tax agreement, the ‘30% ruling’, may apply to non-Dutch applicants. The Collective Labour Agreement of Dutch Universities is applicable.

For one of Europe’s most sustainable biodiesel producers and fuel suppliers, we are looking for a Senior Business Controller.
The Company was established in 2001 and is involved in the manufacture of large scale commercial biodiesel. The award-winning Company makes its clean, green road fuel by recycling wastes and residues from other industries - specifically waste from the food industry and tallow from the meat industry. It has also pioneered the use of low grade waste fats and oils such as “fatbergs” from the UK’s water industry.
As well as supplying bulk biodiesel to European customers, they specialise in the supply of high grade, sustainable diesel for fleet operators, delivering to over 100 UK depots. They provide the best economic value to their customers along with a range of greenhouse gas savings from their products.
By producing environmental fuel, their aim is to contribute to the global battle against climate change and help maximise the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from transport. The Company has three manufacturing facilities for waste-based biodiesel and continues to invest in further growth.
In 2013 the group was acquired by a leading private investment company and in 2018 reached agreement to buy biodiesel production facilities, tank storage and cleaning facilities in the Netherlands. The addition of these facilities represents the first step for the company in replicating its successful business outside the UK. The company is now located in the Netherlands, Scotland and North West England.
