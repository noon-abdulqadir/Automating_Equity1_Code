Recent experiments provide evidence that symbiotic microbes demonstrate transport and trade behaviors reminiscent of human economics. What is the repertoire of strategies at play in these biological \u2018markets\u2019 and how do they depend on the specific combination of species and strains involved? To what extent is the strategy of one partner responsive to that of others, and how are the necessary communications/computations implemented mechanistically?\n\nIn this project, you will address these questions experimentally, developing novel methods for tracking symbiotic trade across time and space, combining the state of the art in fluorescent labelling, automated microscopy and image analysis. A focal symbiotic partnership is between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and plant roots, which form an extended symbiotic network of ecological/agricultural importance in the soil. You will build on our existing automated imaging experiment of this symbiosis using in vitro root cultures, introducing new fungal and bacterial species in the mix. Results will be analyzed using concepts from statistical physics and network theory. A central aim is to illuminate trade strategies and their underlying mechanisms with biophysical data on network growth, resource fluxes and their control by symbiotic context.\n\nThe project builds on our prior work to characterize resource fluxes using quantum-dot labelled nutrients to track symbiotic trade (Whiteside et al., 2019, Curr Biol), and will be embedded within a new HFSP-funded consortium to pioneer the biophysics of fungi in symbiotic contexts.
