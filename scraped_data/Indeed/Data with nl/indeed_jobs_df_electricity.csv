Eventually, these processes of different electricity organisations in Europe need to come together, which is a huge challenge.

Your role? You are the Project Management Officer (PMO), the independent driving force of these teams. You guide them in their process to achieve results and solutions despite the large differences between the organisations, their different interests and ways of working. From a neutral position you ensure that decisions are made and progress is achieved. Often you add value by proposing new solutions where necessary and feasible. We call this business diplomacy, which is used to achieve consensus between the different stakeholders. Primarily, you are also a project manager, who offers structure and clarity and follows-up on actions and deadlines.

You will learn a lot while working on different disciplines and challenges, perfect for someone who graduated recently and who wants to make an impact.

WHAT DO WE OFFER?

Why choose Magnus Red? We offer a stimulating working environment: a young and international team of about 40 consultants and project managers. They are all motivated professionals who respect each other and want to learn from each other. No egos, but commitment and fun, also outside working hours.

We are there for you to help you grow. You learn most on the job, but we also offer an extensive training program. A program with internal and external trainings on the European Electricity Sector, project management and soft skills. Next to that, there are expectations and also a lot of room for your own ideas to keep improving our services. Sounds good?

WHO ARE WE LOOKING FOR?

You are an analytical young professional who combines organisational skills with knowledge of people and a drive to deliver results! In addition, the following profile matches you:

Master’s degree in a technical, science, business or international relations direction with excellent grades;
0 to 3 years working experience; project management experience is valuable;
Proven international experience in which you have demonstrated your organisational talent and facilitating skills;
Interesting secondary activities that show you that you have an entrepreneurial mindset and take the initiative;
Strong communication: you mobilise people with all kinds of backgrounds and your English is excellent (great if you speak several European languages);
Analytically strong: of course you are smart, but you are also structured and able to think ahead;
And also demonstrably interested in the European energy sector! It is a plus if you already have some experience.
WHO ARE WE?

Start Making A Difference is what working at Magnus Red entails. To have a direct impact on challenging projects, that is what we want. Our fast growing team of consultants work on national and international projects at various clients in energy, media, retail and e-commerce sectors. In order to achieve excellent results, we always want to get the best out of ourselves – and each other. Your professional and personal growth is top priority! You get an extra boost through Young Red. Together with other young professionals you share experiences, follow training courses and organize social events.

As an installations worker you start on the first monday of january. Why so early in the year?

How does your job look like as a maintenance worker?

As soon as the installation workers have put everything into place, it will be up to you to connect everything. Think about connecting the mobile homes, connecting them to the water, connecting them to the electricity. As a maintenance worker you will work in a certain area, so not just at one campsite. That makes the job so much fun and not a day will be the same. After everything is installed and the campsites are opening, you will be responsible for the reperations at the campsites. For example when a fridge will break down at an accommodation where guests are staying. Ofcourse it's important that the reperations will be done as soon as possible. Together with your other colleagues at the campsites, you will make sure that the guests have an experience that they will never forget. Your workinglocation will be Italy.
