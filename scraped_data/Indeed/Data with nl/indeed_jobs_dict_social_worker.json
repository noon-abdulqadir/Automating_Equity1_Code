The candidate should be available in February \u2013 April 2021 and December 2022 \u2013 February 2023.\nDeadline for submitting proposals: Monday 25 January 2021\n\n\nBackground\n\nAflatoun International is a non-profit organization, which offers social and financial education to children and young people worldwide, empowering them to make a positive change for a more equitable world. Aflatoun creates high-quality curricula, for different age groups, which are contextualized to local needs and specific circumstances. In 2019, Aflatoun reached 10.5 million children in 108 countries through over 345 partner organizations.\nAflatoun programs inspire children to discover their talents and put them to use, to stand up for their rights and those of their communities, to play games, and to solve problems. They learn how to save, how to budget, and how to set up social and financial enterprises that benefit themselves, their families, and their communities.\nAflatoun has been identified as a best in practice organisation by The Brookings Institution in the report 'Can We Leapfrog? The Potential of Education Innovations to Rapidly Accelerate Progress\u2019. The report presents a forward path in global education by examining the possibility of using innovations to \u2018leapfrog\u2019, rapidly accelerating educational progress to ensure that all young people develop the skills they need to thrive in a fast-changing world. Additionally, in 2019, HundrED Connect officially recognized Aflatoun as one of top 5 Spotlight Innovators for its work on financial education. HundrED Connect is an initiative that aims to improve education and inspire a movement by encouraging pedagogically sound and ambitious innovations to spread across the world. Aflatoun was also selected as an official Vanguard Member of the Million Lives Club, which celebrates innovators and social entrepreneurs who are reaching new horizons of impact and improving the lives of those living on less than $5 a day, and who have already scaled to serve at least 1,000,000 people.\n\n\nProject information\n\nWhile significant progress has been made towards universal primary school attendance, the reality is that a third (34%) of children of lower secondary school age (12-14 years) and more than half (58%) of 15 to 17-year-olds in sub-Saharan Africa are not in school. Hence, majority of those who should be acquiring the skills to prepare them for the job market, or move into further education, are not in the classroom, making it less likely that they will have a positive impact on their countries\u2019 development.\nImproving youth\u2019s future prospects for decent work helps break the intergenerational cycle of poverty and is beneficial for entire communities. To do so, it is crucial that adolescents understand money, resources and the markets that increasingly affect them, as they become consumers, workers and active citizens. This greatly improves their prospects for the future, as it prepares young people for a complex and turbulent job market.\n\nthis context, Aflatoun will roll out its Aflateen+ programme in Mozambique through its partnership with implementing organization Wona Sanana (WS).\nWona Sanana (WS) is a Mozambique-based organization dedicated to Child Protection and Education through providing technical assistance to local actors focusing on youth and education, and through advocating for the involvement of government agencies to ensure inclusive education and child protection policies.\nAflateen+ is a comprehensive educational programme to transform the lives of adolescent girls and boys aged 14-19 through social and financial education, and entrepreneurship with a gender lens. The programme\u2019s biggest strength is its flexibility to adapt to the local needs of the girls and boys, while offering a variety of lessons on life skills, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and financial empowerment. Throughout the lessons, the connection between gender equality and economic prosperity is emphasized. The project\u2019s overall objective is\nTo socially and economically empower young girls and boys (ages of 14 to 19) in Mozambique by providing them with the social and financial skills necessary to make informed choices about their health, financial situation, and education.\n\n\nImpact assessment\n\nTo assess the impact of the Aflateen+ programme on adolescent girls and boys in Mozambique, this research will use a mixed-method approach, with a heavy quantitative component. The study will collect and evaluate quantitative data through a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) and qualitative data from e.g. Most Significant Change or Focus Group Discussions.\nThe main question of the research is: What is the effect of the Aflateen+ programme among participants of the Aflateen+ programme, relative to the representative control sample in Mozambique?\nSince the project runs over three years, we aim to not only measure knowledge, awareness and attitudes of adolescent girls and boys, but also assess the impact of the programme on SDG outcome and impact indicators like school retention/attendance/drop-out, teenage pregnancy, gender based violence, and HIV-risk behaviour.\n\n\nCapacity assessment\n\nIn order to assess the effectiveness of the capacity building component of the project, the research will include two tools assessing the capacity of both trained partners/NGOs, as well as trained teachers/educators.\nAdding to that, as a follow up to the training of teachers, weekly push messages will be sent to the teachers or trainers via SMS or social media platforms. These messages may be questions or surveys on the progress of Aflateen+ activities. Additionally, micro content that reinforces learning, or guides teaching activities will be shared.\nThe evidence generated through this study will assist in regional advocacy and Aflatoun\u2019s engagement with regional bodies like SADC and the African Union, which will contribute to our efforts towards education system change.\n\n\nExperience requirements\nResearch institute/consultants should have:\n1.

As a PhD student you are supervised by research staff at TNO and academic staff at TU Delft. You will have the opportunity to collaborate on the technologically challenging projects of the Wind Energy research group at TNO and be part of the Department of Aerodynamics, Wind Energy and Propulsion of the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering of the TU Delft. You will also be part of the Graduate School of the TU Delft.\n\nThe quest for robust and higher power output at reduced costs per offshore wind turbine drives the design towards increasingly larger rotor diameters that have positive influence on the usage of the electrical grid (by larger capacity factor) and wind farm power production. To counter the increased mechanical loading in extreme off-design conditions these increasingly larger rotors have relatively small solidity. The much slender rotors therefore have to be equipped with thicker rotor blades. The drawback of thicker blade sections is their use is accompanied with large uncertainties in performance. This is motivating the application of vortex generators (VG) and thick trailing edges.\n\nVGs are commonly used on wind turbine blades to avoid early separation of flow which helps not only to increase the lift but also delays the stall leading to increased blade robustness. Delaying the stall angle of wind turbine blades will allow for operation over larger range of angle of attacks and thus increase power production from wind turbines. Although effects of VGs are studied by various researchers a model depicting the effects of these devices in an aerodynamic design tool is important to design state of the art airfoil sections/wind turbine blades. Furthermore, this project aims to investigate and model the effects of VGs in unsteady flow conditions, which is a challenging new research topic.\n\nIn this project we will approximate the effects of the VGs on the 2-D unsteady boundary layers so that it can be modelled as additional mixing in the fast and accurate aerodynamic design tools based on integral boundary layer equations (e.g. RFoil). The presence of a new shear layer will lead to additional viscous dissipation and affect the wall shear stress. To model these effects, new terms are introduced into the integral boundary layer equations to account for the extra mass and momentum flux and turbulence production. Both TNO and TUDelft have developed preliminary models to account for these effects and these models will be integrated.\n\nAbout TNO\nTNO is an independent research organisation that functions as a bridge between the worlds of academia and industry, and the public sector. TNO has around 3,500 employees working within nine domains for a wide range of clients, such as government agencies, the SME sector, civil society organisations, larger companies and service providers. We aim to translate research findings into straightforward applications and innovations to solve the challenges the world will encounter the day after tomorrow. We take the time to think calmly and thoroughly about issues and, once a project has been completed, we continue our search for tools, models and recommendations that will benefit our clients and society as a whole in the future.\nRead more about TNO as an employer\nWhat do we require of you?\nYou have a good set of brains, a passion for renewable energy in general and wind energy in particular, and great social skills. After all, you will always be working with others, as part of project teams or larger consortiums to solve societal issues. You don\u2019t have to know everything about the entire field (although we wouldn\u2019t mind it if you did). The most important thing is that you have a broad interest in applied scientific research and a passion for wind energy and similar topics. You\u2019re also not afraid to get out of your comfort zone and are eager to develop further.\n\nOther qualifications we\u2019re looking for:\nAn MSc degree in Aerospace Engineering from a well-established university, or an MSc degree in related engineering disciplines such as applied physics, applied mathematics, or mechanical engineering with a proven experience (courses, projects, work experience) in the field of computational fluid mechanics.\nA combination of good mathematical/analytical skills and a strong interest in high-fidelity numerical simulations is required.\nExperience with CFD methods (such as SU2, OpenFOAM) is preferred.\nProven experience with such simulations and related data processing is advantageous for this position.\nSince an important part of research work is dissemination and collaboration, fluent communication skills, both written and orally, in English are of utmost importance.\nFemale scientists are particularly encouraged to apply.\nThe research will start with a literature survey on the vortex generators (VGs) and modelling concepts for the higher and lower fidelity methods including the mathematical model developed by TNO. Previous experimental study and numerical (CFD) simulations will give an insight about the VGs and the model.\n\nAs a next main task CFD simulations (with an open source tool, e.g. SU2, OpenFOAM) will be performed on airfoil sections with and without VGs to construct the model data and the extend the original model. The first milestone will be implementing the steady VG model in RFOIL. This study will be supported by experimental data provided by partners of the project. The experiments will also contain information about unsteady flow conditions. The effect of these unsteady flow conditions in combination of VGs will be evaluated. A new set of innovative airfoil sections will be designed in various thicknesses that are optimized for VGs and thick trailing edges.\n\nAs the final main task of the research the PhD student will investigate the existing BAY VG model(s) as implemented in the open source CFD tools (e.g. OpenFOAM) and improve this model for the unsteady flow conditions. In order to see the effects of the VGs on the 3D flow, numerical simulations will be performed for relevant Reynolds numbers both with the BAY model and body fitted mesh. The unsteady velocity field will be analysed to get a better insight of the flow field. A new innovative blade will be designed including the effects of vortex generators. In the blade design the airfoil sections designed previously will be used.\n\nReferences\n1. https://doi.org/10.1002/we.2191\n2. https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2019-0803\n3. https://doi.org/10.4233/uuid:99b15acb-e25e-4cd9-8541-1e4056c1baed\n4. https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033788\n5. https://doi.org/10.1002/we.2204\n\nView Marcelien Bos-de Koning's vlog about wind energy at the North Sea.\nWhat can you expect of your work situation?\nWithin TNO, you\u2019ll be part of the Wind Energy research group, which is part of the Unit Energy Transition.

HundrED Connect is an initiative that aims to improve education and inspire a movement by encouraging pedagogically sound and ambitious innovations to spread across the world. Aflatoun was also selected as an official Vanguard Member of the Million Lives Club, which celebrates innovators and social entrepreneurs who are reaching new horizons of impact and improving the lives of those living on less than $5 a day, and who have already scaled to serve at least 1,000,000 people.\n\n\nProject information\nWhile significant progress has been made towards universal primary school attendance, the reality is that a third (34%) of children of lower secondary school age (12-14 years) and more than half (58%) of 15 to 17-year-olds in sub-Saharan Africa are not in school. Hence, majority of those who should be acquiring the skills to prepare them for the job market, or move into further education, are not in the classroom, making it less likely that they will have a positive impact on their countries\u2019 development.\nImproving youth\u2019s future prospects for decent work helps break the intergenerational cycle of poverty and is beneficial for entire communities. To do so, it is crucial that adolescents understand money, resources and the markets that increasingly affect them, as they become consumers, workers and active citizens. This greatly improves their prospects for the future, as it prepares young people for a complex and turbulent job market.\n\nIn this light, Aflatoun will roll out its Aflateen+ programme in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire through its partnership with implementing organization Inades Formation.\nInades Formation is a Pan-African, non-profit organisation currently operating from field offices across 10 African countries. Their aim is to promote social and economic development of rural populations through stimulating and supporting development alternatives within rural communities. The organization conducts citizen-based advocacy work aimed at contributing towards the development of shared values for living together, rules of governance and policies for the common good.\nAflateen+ is a comprehensive educational programme to transform the lives of adolescent girls and boys aged 14-19 through social and financial education, and entrepreneurship with a gender lens. The programme\u2019s biggest strength is its flexibility to adapt to the local needs of the girls and boys, while offering a variety of lessons on life skills, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and financial empowerment. Throughout the lessons, the connection between gender equality and economic prosperity is emphasized. The project\u2019s overall objective is\nTo socially and economically empower young girls and boys (ages of 14 to 19) in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire by providing them with the social and financial skills necessary to make informed choices about their health, financial situation, and education.\n\n\nImpact assessment\n\nTo assess the impact of the Aflateen+ programme on adolescent girls and boys in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, this research will use a mixed-method approach, with a heavy quantitative component. The study will collect and evaluate quantitative data through a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) and qualitative data from e.g. Most Significant Change or Focus Group Discussions.\nThe main question of the research is: What is the effect of the Aflateen+ programme among participants of the Aflateen+ programme, relative to the representative control sample in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire?\nSince the project runs over three years, we aim to not only measure knowledge, awareness and attitudes of adolescent girls and boys, but also assess the impact of the programme on SDG outcome and impact indicators like school retention/attendance/drop-out, teenage pregnancy, gender based violence, and HIV-risk behaviour.\n\n\nCapacity assessment\n\nIn order to assess the effectiveness of the capacity building component of the project, the research will include two tools assessing the capacity of both trained partners/NGOs, as well as trained teachers/educators.\nAdding to that, as a follow up to the training of teachers, weekly push messages will be sent to the teachers or trainers via SMS or social media platforms. These messages may be questions or surveys on the progress of Aflateen+ activities. Additionally, micro content that reinforces learning, or guides teaching activities will be shared.\nThe evidence generated through this study will assist in regional advocacy and Aflatoun\u2019s engagement with regional bodies like SADC and the African Union, which will contribute to our efforts towards education system change.\n\nExperience requirements\nResearch institute/consultants should have:\n1. Experience conducting Random Control Trials;\n2. Extensive experience with leading a team of researchers and data enumerators incl. training of data enumerators on the use of evaluation tools;\n3.

The report presents a forward path in global education by examining the possibility of using innovations to \u2018leapfrog\u2019, rapidly accelerating educational progress to ensure that all young people develop the skills they need to thrive in a fast-changing world. Additionally, in 2019, HundrED Connect officially recognized Aflatoun as one of top 5 Spotlight Innovators for its work on financial education. HundrED Connect is an initiative that aims to improve education and inspire a movement by encouraging pedagogically sound and ambitious innovations to spread across the world. Aflatoun was also selected as an official Vanguard Member of the Million Lives Club, which celebrates innovators and social entrepreneurs who are reaching new horizons of impact and improving the lives of those living on less than $5 a day, and who have already scaled to serve at least 1,000,000 people.\n\n\nProject information\nWhile significant progress has been made towards universal primary school attendance, the reality is that a third (34%) of children of lower secondary school age (12-14 years) and more than half (58%) of 15 to 17-year-olds in sub-Saharan Africa are not in school. Hence, majority of those who should be acquiring the skills to prepare them for the job market, or move into further education, are not in the classroom, making it less likely that they will have a positive impact on their countries\u2019 development.\nImproving youth\u2019s future prospects for decent work helps break the intergenerational cycle of poverty and is beneficial for entire communities. To do so, it is crucial that adolescents understand money, resources and the markets that increasingly affect them, as they become consumers, workers and active citizens. This greatly improves their prospects for the future, as it prepares young people for a complex and turbulent job market.\n\nIn this context, Aflatoun will roll out its Aflateen+ programme in Zimbabwe through its partnership with implementing organization Junior Achievement Zimbabwe. Junior Achievement Zimbabwe is a not-for-profit organization aiming to prepare and inspire young people to value free enterprise, business, economics and entrepreneurship.\nAflateen+ is a comprehensive educational programme to transform the lives of adolescent girls and boys aged 14-19 through social and financial education, and entrepreneurship with a gender lens. The programme\u2019s biggest strength is its flexibility to adapt to the local needs of the girls and boys, while offering a variety of lessons on life skills, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and financial empowerment. Throughout the lessons, the connection between gender equality and economic prosperity is emphasized. The project\u2019s overall objective is\nTo socially and economically empower young girls and boys (ages of 14 to 19) in Zimbabwe by providing them with the social and financial skills necessary to make informed choices about their health, financial situation, and education.\n\n\nImpact assessment\n\nTo assess the impact of the Aflateen+ programme on adolescent girls and boys in Zimbabwe, this research will use a mixed-method approach, with a heavy quantitative component. The study will collect and evaluate quantitative data through a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) and qualitative data from e.g. Most Significant Change or Focus Group Discussions.\nThe main question of the research is: What is the effect of the Aflateen+ programme among participants of the Aflateen+ programme, relative to the representative control sample in Zimbabwe?\nSince the project runs over three years, we aim to not only measure knowledge, awareness and attitudes of adolescent girls and boys, but also assess the impact of the programme on SDG outcome and impact indicators like school retention/attendance/drop-out, teenage pregnancy, gender based violence, and HIV-risk behaviour.\n\n\nCapacity assessment\nIn order to assess the effectiveness of the capacity building component of the project, the research will include two tools assessing the capacity of both trained partners/NGOs, as well as trained teachers/educators.\nAdding to that, as a follow up to the training of teachers, weekly push messages will be sent to the teachers or trainers via SMS or social media platforms. These messages may be questions or surveys on the progress of Aflateen+ activities. Additionally, micro content that reinforces learning, or guides teaching activities will be shared.\nThe evidence generated through this study will assist in regional advocacy and Aflatoun\u2019s engagement with regional bodies like SADC and the African Union, which will contribute to our efforts towards education system change.\n\n\nExperience requirements\nResearch institute/consultants should have:\n1.

The candidate should be available in February \u2013 April 2021 and December 2022 \u2013 February 2023.\nDeadline for submitting proposals: Monday 25 January 2021\n\n\nBackground\n\nAflatoun International is a non-profit organization, which offers social and financial education to children and young people worldwide, empowering them to make a positive change for a more equitable world. Aflatoun creates high-quality curricula, for different age groups, which are contextualized to local needs and specific circumstances. In 2019, Aflatoun reached 10.5 million children in 108 countries through over 345 partner organizations.\nAflatoun programs inspire children to discover their talents and put them to use, to stand up for their rights and those of their communities, to play games, and to solve problems. They learn how to save, how to budget, and how to set up social and financial enterprises that benefit themselves, their families, and their communities.\nAflatoun has been identified as a best in practice organisation by The Brookings Institution in the report 'Can We Leapfrog? The Potential of Education Innovations to Rapidly Accelerate Progress\u2019. The report presents a forward path in global education by examining the possibility of using innovations to \u2018leapfrog\u2019, rapidly accelerating educational progress to ensure that all young people develop the skills they need to thrive in a fast-changing world. Additionally, in 2019, HundrED Connect officially recognized Aflatoun as one of top 5 Spotlight Innovators for its work on financial education. HundrED Connect is an initiative that aims to improve education and inspire a movement by encouraging pedagogically sound and ambitious innovations to spread across the world. Aflatoun was also selected as an official Vanguard Member of the Million Lives Club, which celebrates innovators and social entrepreneurs who are reaching new horizons of impact and improving the lives of those living on less than $5 a day, and who have already scaled to serve at least 1,000,000 people.\n\n\nProject information\n\nWhile significant progress has been made towards universal primary school attendance, the reality is that a third (34%) of children of lower secondary school age (12-14 years) and more than half (58%) of 15 to 17-year-olds in sub-Saharan Africa are not in school. Hence, majority of those who should be acquiring the skills to prepare them for the job market, or move into further education, are not in the classroom, making it less likely that they will have a positive impact on their countries\u2019 development.\nImproving youth\u2019s future prospects for decent work helps break the intergenerational cycle of poverty and is beneficial for entire communities. To do so, it is crucial that adolescents understand money, resources and the markets that increasingly affect them, as they become consumers, workers and active citizens. This greatly improves their prospects for the future, as it prepares young people for a complex and turbulent job market.\n\nthis context, Aflatoun will roll out its Aflateen+ programme in Mozambique through its partnership with implementing organization Wona Sanana (WS).\nWona Sanana (WS) is a Mozambique-based organization dedicated to Child Protection and Education through providing technical assistance to local actors focusing on youth and education, and through advocating for the involvement of government agencies to ensure inclusive education and child protection policies.\nAflateen+ is a comprehensive educational programme to transform the lives of adolescent girls and boys aged 14-19 through social and financial education, and entrepreneurship with a gender lens. The programme\u2019s biggest strength is its flexibility to adapt to the local needs of the girls and boys, while offering a variety of lessons on life skills, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and financial empowerment. Throughout the lessons, the connection between gender equality and economic prosperity is emphasized. The project\u2019s overall objective is\nTo socially and economically empower young girls and boys (ages of 14 to 19) in Mozambique by providing them with the social and financial skills necessary to make informed choices about their health, financial situation, and education.\n\n\nImpact assessment\n\nTo assess the impact of the Aflateen+ programme on adolescent girls and boys in Mozambique, this research will use a mixed-method approach, with a heavy quantitative component. The study will collect and evaluate quantitative data through a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) and qualitative data from e.g. Most Significant Change or Focus Group Discussions.\nThe main question of the research is: What is the effect of the Aflateen+ programme among participants of the Aflateen+ programme, relative to the representative control sample in Mozambique?\nSince the project runs over three years, we aim to not only measure knowledge, awareness and attitudes of adolescent girls and boys, but also assess the impact of the programme on SDG outcome and impact indicators like school retention/attendance/drop-out, teenage pregnancy, gender based violence, and HIV-risk behaviour.\n\n\nCapacity assessment\n\nIn order to assess the effectiveness of the capacity building component of the project, the research will include two tools assessing the capacity of both trained partners/NGOs, as well as trained teachers/educators.\nAdding to that, as a follow up to the training of teachers, weekly push messages will be sent to the teachers or trainers via SMS or social media platforms. These messages may be questions or surveys on the progress of Aflateen+ activities. Additionally, micro content that reinforces learning, or guides teaching activities will be shared.\nThe evidence generated through this study will assist in regional advocacy and Aflatoun\u2019s engagement with regional bodies like SADC and the African Union, which will contribute to our efforts towards education system change.\n\n\nExperience requirements\nResearch institute/consultants should have:\n1. Experience conducting Random Control Trials;\n\n2. Extensive experience with leading a team of researchers and data enumerators incl. training of data enumerators on the use of evaluation tools;\n3.

As a PhD student you are supervised by research staff at TNO and academic staff at TU Delft. You will have the opportunity to collaborate on the technologically challenging projects of the Wind Energy research group at TNO and be part of the Department of Aerodynamics, Wind Energy and Propulsion of the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering of the TU Delft. You will also be part of the Graduate School of the TU Delft.\n\nThe quest for robust and higher power output at reduced costs per offshore wind turbine drives the design towards increasingly larger rotor diameters that have positive influence on the usage of the electrical grid (by larger capacity factor) and wind farm power production. To counter the increased mechanical loading in extreme off-design conditions these increasingly larger rotors have relatively small solidity. The much slender rotors therefore have to be equipped with thicker rotor blades. The drawback of thicker blade sections is their use is accompanied with large uncertainties in performance. This is motivating the application of vortex generators (VG) and thick trailing edges.\n\nVGs are commonly used on wind turbine blades to avoid early separation of flow which helps not only to increase the lift but also delays the stall leading to increased blade robustness. Delaying the stall angle of wind turbine blades will allow for operation over larger range of angle of attacks and thus increase power production from wind turbines. Although effects of VGs are studied by various researchers a model depicting the effects of these devices in an aerodynamic design tool is important to design state of the art airfoil sections/wind turbine blades. Furthermore, this project aims to investigate and model the effects of VGs in unsteady flow conditions, which is a challenging new research topic.\n\nIn this project we will approximate the effects of the VGs on the 2-D unsteady boundary layers so that it can be modelled as additional mixing in the fast and accurate aerodynamic design tools based on integral boundary layer equations (e.g. RFoil). The presence of a new shear layer will lead to additional viscous dissipation and affect the wall shear stress. To model these effects, new terms are introduced into the integral boundary layer equations to account for the extra mass and momentum flux and turbulence production. Both TNO and TUDelft have developed preliminary models to account for these effects and these models will be integrated.\n\nAbout TNO\nTNO is an independent research organisation that functions as a bridge between the worlds of academia and industry, and the public sector. TNO has around 3,500 employees working within nine domains for a wide range of clients, such as government agencies, the SME sector, civil society organisations, larger companies and service providers. We aim to translate research findings into straightforward applications and innovations to solve the challenges the world will encounter the day after tomorrow. We take the time to think calmly and thoroughly about issues and, once a project has been completed, we continue our search for tools, models and recommendations that will benefit our clients and society as a whole in the future.\nRead more about TNO as an employer\nWhat do we require of you?\nYou have a good set of brains, a passion for renewable energy in general and wind energy in particular, and great social skills. After all, you will always be working with others, as part of project teams or larger consortiums to solve societal issues. You don\u2019t have to know everything about the entire field (although we wouldn\u2019t mind it if you did). The most important thing is that you have a broad interest in applied scientific research and a passion for wind energy and similar topics. You\u2019re also not afraid to get out of your comfort zone and are eager to develop further.\n\nOther qualifications we\u2019re looking for:\nAn MSc degree in Aerospace Engineering from a well-established university, or an MSc degree in related engineering disciplines such as applied physics, applied mathematics, or mechanical engineering with a proven experience (courses, projects, work experience) in the field of computational fluid mechanics.\nA combination of good mathematical/analytical skills and a strong interest in high-fidelity numerical simulations is required.\nExperience with CFD methods (such as SU2, OpenFOAM) is preferred.\nProven experience with such simulations and related data processing is advantageous for this position.\nSince an important part of research work is dissemination and collaboration, fluent communication skills, both written and orally, in English are of utmost importance.\nFemale scientists are particularly encouraged to apply.\nThe research will start with a literature survey on the vortex generators (VGs) and modelling concepts for the higher and lower fidelity methods including the mathematical model developed by TNO. Previous experimental study and numerical (CFD) simulations will give an insight about the VGs and the model.\n\nAs a next main task CFD simulations (with an open source tool, e.g. SU2, OpenFOAM) will be performed on airfoil sections with and without VGs to construct the model data and the extend the original model. The first milestone will be implementing the steady VG model in RFOIL. This study will be supported by experimental data provided by partners of the project. The experiments will also contain information about unsteady flow conditions. The effect of these unsteady flow conditions in combination of VGs will be evaluated. A new set of innovative airfoil sections will be designed in various thicknesses that are optimized for VGs and thick trailing edges.\n\nAs the final main task of the research the PhD student will investigate the existing BAY VG model(s) as implemented in the open source CFD tools (e.g. OpenFOAM) and improve this model for the unsteady flow conditions. In order to see the effects of the VGs on the 3D flow, numerical simulations will be performed for relevant Reynolds numbers both with the BAY model and body fitted mesh. The unsteady velocity field will be analysed to get a better insight of the flow field. A new innovative blade will be designed including the effects of vortex generators. In the blade design the airfoil sections designed previously will be used.\n\nReferences\n1. https://doi.org/10.1002/we.2191\n2. https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2019-0803\n3. https://doi.org/10.4233/uuid:99b15acb-e25e-4cd9-8541-1e4056c1baed\n4. https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033788\n5. https://doi.org/10.1002/we.2204\n\nView Marcelien Bos-de Koning's vlog about wind energy at the North Sea.\nWhat can you expect of your work situation?\nWithin TNO, you\u2019ll be part of the Wind Energy research group, which is part of the Unit Energy Transition.

The candidate should be available in February \u2013April 2021 and December 2022 \u2013 February 2023.\nDeadline for submitting proposals: Monday 25 January 2021\n\n\nBackground\n\nAflatoun International is a non-profit organization, which offers social and financial education to children and young people worldwide, empowering them to make a positive change for a more equitable world. Aflatoun creates high-quality curricula, for different age groups, which are contextualized to local needs and specific circumstances. In 2019, Aflatoun reached 10.5 million children in 108 countries through over 345 partner organizations.\nAflatoun programs inspire children to discover their talents and put them to use, to stand up for their rights and those of their communities, to play games, and to solve problems. They learn how to save, how to budget, and how to set up social and financial enterprises that benefit themselves, their families, and their communities.\nAflatoun has been identified as a best in practice organisation by The Brookings Institution in the report 'Can We Leapfrog? The Potential of Education Innovations to Rapidly Accelerate Progress\u2019. The report presents a forward path in global education by examining the possibility of using innovations to \u2018leapfrog\u2019, rapidly accelerating educational progress to ensure that all young people develop the skills they need to thrive in a fast-changing world. Additionally, in 2019, HundrED Connect officially recognized Aflatoun as one of top 5 Spotlight Innovators for its work on financial education. HundrED Connect is an initiative that aims to improve education and inspire a movement by encouraging pedagogically sound and ambitious innovations to spread across the world. Aflatoun was also selected as an official Vanguard Member of the Million Lives Club, which celebrates innovators and social entrepreneurs who are reaching new horizons of impact and improving the lives of those living on less than $5 a day, and who have already scaled to serve at least 1,000,000 people.\n\n\nProject information\nWhile significant progress has been made towards universal primary school attendance, the reality is that a third (34%) of children of lower secondary school age (12-14 years) and more than half (58%) of 15 to 17-year-olds in sub-Saharan Africa are not in school. Hence, majority of those who should be acquiring the skills to prepare them for the job market, or move into further education, are not in the classroom, making it less likely that they will have a positive impact on their countries\u2019 development.\nImproving youth\u2019s future prospects for decent work helps break the intergenerational cycle of poverty and is beneficial for entire communities. To do so, it is crucial that adolescents understand money, resources and the markets that increasingly affect them, as they become consumers, workers and active citizens. This greatly improves their prospects for the future, as it prepares young people for a complex and turbulent job market.\n\nIn this light, Aflatoun will roll out its Aflateen+ programme in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire through its partnership with implementing organization Inades Formation.\nInades Formation is a Pan-African, non-profit organisation currently operating from field offices across 10 African countries. Their aim is to promote social and economic development of rural populations through stimulating and supporting development alternatives within rural communities. The organization conducts citizen-based advocacy work aimed at contributing towards the development of shared values for living together, rules of governance and policies for the common good.\nAflateen+ is a comprehensive educational programme to transform the lives of adolescent girls and boys aged 14-19 through social and financial education, and entrepreneurship with a gender lens. The programme\u2019s biggest strength is its flexibility to adapt to the local needs of the girls and boys, while offering a variety of lessons on life skills, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and financial empowerment. Throughout the lessons, the connection between gender equality and economic prosperity is emphasized. The project\u2019s overall objective is\nTo socially and economically empower young girls and boys (ages of 14 to 19) in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire by providing them with the social and financial skills necessary to make informed choices about their health, financial situation, and education.\n\n\nImpact assessment\n\nTo assess the impact of the Aflateen+ programme on adolescent girls and boys in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, this research will use a mixed-method approach, with a heavy quantitative component. The study will collect and evaluate quantitative data through a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) and qualitative data from e.g. Most Significant Change or Focus Group Discussions.\nThe main question of the research is: What is the effect of the Aflateen+ programme among participants of the Aflateen+ programme, relative to the representative control sample in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire?\nSince the project runs over three years, we aim to not only measure knowledge, awareness and attitudes of adolescent girls and boys, but also assess the impact of the programme on SDG outcome and impact indicators like school retention/attendance/drop-out, teenage pregnancy, gender based violence, and HIV-risk behaviour.\n\n\nCapacity assessment\n\nIn order to assess the effectiveness of the capacity building component of the project, the research will include two tools assessing the capacity of both trained partners/NGOs, as well as trained teachers/educators.\nAdding to that, as a follow up to the training of teachers, weekly push messages will be sent to the teachers or trainers via SMS or social media platforms. These messages may be questions or surveys on the progress of Aflateen+ activities. Additionally, micro content that reinforces learning, or guides teaching activities will be shared.\nThe evidence generated through this study will assist in regional advocacy and Aflatoun\u2019s engagement with regional bodies like SADC and the African Union, which will contribute to our efforts towards education system change.\n\nExperience requirements\nResearch institute/consultants should have:\n1.

The candidate should be available in February \u2013 April 2021 and December 2022 \u2013 February 2023.\n\nDeadline for submitting proposals: Monday 25 January 2021\n\n\nBackground\nAflatoun International is a non-profit organization, which offers social and financial education to children and young people worldwide, empowering them to make a positive change for a more equitable world. Aflatoun creates high-quality curricula, for different age groups, which are contextualized to local needs and specific circumstances. In 2019, Aflatoun reached 10.5 million children in 108 countries through over 345 partner organizations.\nAflatoun programs inspire children to discover their talents and put them to use, to stand up for their rights and those of their communities, to play games, and to solve problems. They learn how to save, how to budget, and how to set up social and financial enterprises that benefit themselves, their families, and their communities.\nAflatoun has been identified as a best in practice organisation by The Brookings Institution in the report 'Can We Leapfrog? The Potential of Education Innovations to Rapidly Accelerate Progress\u2019. The report presents a forward path in global education by examining the possibility of using innovations to \u2018leapfrog\u2019, rapidly accelerating educational progress to ensure that all young people develop the skills they need to thrive in a fast-changing world. Additionally, in 2019, HundrED Connect officially recognized Aflatoun as one of top 5 Spotlight Innovators for its work on financial education. HundrED Connect is an initiative that aims to improve education and inspire a movement by encouraging pedagogically sound and ambitious innovations to spread across the world. Aflatoun was also selected as an official Vanguard Member of the Million Lives Club, which celebrates innovators and social entrepreneurs who are reaching new horizons of impact and improving the lives of those living on less than $5 a day, and who have already scaled to serve at least 1,000,000 people.\n\n\nProject information\nWhile significant progress has been made towards universal primary school attendance, the reality is that a third (34%) of children of lower secondary school age (12-14 years) and more than half (58%) of 15 to 17-year-olds in sub-Saharan Africa are not in school. Hence, majority of those who should be acquiring the skills to prepare them for the job market, or move into further education, are not in the classroom, making it less likely that they will have a positive impact on their countries\u2019 development.\nImproving youth\u2019s future prospects for decent work helps break the intergenerational cycle of poverty and is beneficial for entire communities. To do so, it is crucial that adolescents understand money, resources and the markets that increasingly affect them, as they become consumers, workers and active citizens. This greatly improves their prospects for the future, as it prepares young people for a complex and turbulent job market.\n\nIn this context, Aflatoun will roll out its Aflateen+ programme in Zimbabwe through its partnership with implementing organization Junior Achievement Zimbabwe. Junior Achievement Zimbabwe is a not-for-profit organization aiming to prepare and inspire young people to value free enterprise, business, economics and entrepreneurship.\nAflateen+ is a comprehensive educational programme to transform the lives of adolescent girls and boys aged 14-19 through social and financial education, and entrepreneurship with a gender lens. The programme\u2019s biggest strength is its flexibility to adapt to the local needs of the girls and boys, while offering a variety of lessons on life skills, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and financial empowerment. Throughout the lessons, the connection between gender equality and economic prosperity is emphasized. The project\u2019s overall objective is\nTo socially and economically empower young girls and boys (ages of 14 to 19) in Zimbabwe by providing them with the social and financial skills necessary to make informed choices about their health, financial situation, and education.\n\n\nImpact assessment\n\nTo assess the impact of the Aflateen+ programme on adolescent girls and boys in Zimbabwe, this research will use a mixed-method approach, with a heavy quantitative component. The study will collect and evaluate quantitative data through a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) and qualitative data from e.g. Most Significant Change or Focus Group Discussions.\nThe main question of the research is: What is the effect of the Aflateen+ programme among participants of the Aflateen+ programme, relative to the representative control sample in Zimbabwe?\nSince the project runs over three years, we aim to not only measure knowledge, awareness and attitudes of adolescent girls and boys, but also assess the impact of the programme on SDG outcome and impact indicators like school retention/attendance/drop-out, teenage pregnancy, gender based violence, and HIV-risk behaviour.\n\n\nCapacity assessment\nIn order to assess the effectiveness of the capacity building component of the project, the research will include two tools assessing the capacity of both trained partners/NGOs, as well as trained teachers/educators.\nAdding to that, as a follow up to the training of teachers, weekly push messages will be sent to the teachers or trainers via SMS or social media platforms. These messages may be questions or surveys on the progress of Aflateen+ activities. Additionally, micro content that reinforces learning, or guides teaching activities will be shared.\nThe evidence generated through this study will assist in regional advocacy and Aflatoun\u2019s engagement with regional bodies like SADC and the African Union, which will contribute to our efforts towards education system change.\n\n\nExperience requirements\nResearch institute/consultants should have:\n1. Experience conducting Random Control Trials;\n2. Extensive experience with leading a team of researchers and data enumerators incl. training of data enumerators on the use of evaluation tools;\n3.

The candidate should be available in February \u2013 April 2021 and December 2022 \u2013 February 2023.\nDeadline for submitting proposals: Monday 25 January 2021\n\n\nBackground\n\nAflatoun International is a non-profit organization, which offers social and financial education to children and young people worldwide, empowering them to make a positive change for a more equitable world. Aflatoun creates high-quality curricula, for different age groups, which are contextualized to local needs and specific circumstances. In 2019, Aflatoun reached 10.5 million children in 108 countries through over 345 partner organizations.\nAflatoun programs inspire children to discover their talents and put them to use, to stand up for their rights and those of their communities, to play games, and to solve problems. They learn how to save, how to budget, and how to set up social and financial enterprises that benefit themselves, their families, and their communities.\nAflatoun has been identified as a best in practice organisation by The Brookings Institution in the report 'Can We Leapfrog? The Potential of Education Innovations to Rapidly Accelerate Progress\u2019. The report presents a forward path in global education by examining the possibility of using innovations to \u2018leapfrog\u2019, rapidly accelerating educational progress to ensure that all young people develop the skills they need to thrive in a fast-changing world. Additionally, in 2019, HundrED Connect officially recognized Aflatoun as one of top 5 Spotlight Innovators for its work on financial education. HundrED Connect is an initiative that aims to improve education and inspire a movement by encouraging pedagogically sound and ambitious innovations to spread across the world. Aflatoun was also selected as an official Vanguard Member of the Million Lives Club, which celebrates innovators and social entrepreneurs who are reaching new horizons of impact and improving the lives of those living on less than $5 a day, and who have already scaled to serve at least 1,000,000 people.\n\n\nProject information\n\nWhile significant progress has been made towards universal primary school attendance, the reality is that a third (34%) of children of lower secondary school age (12-14 years) and more than half (58%) of 15 to 17-year-olds in sub-Saharan Africa are not in school. Hence, majority of those who should be acquiring the skills to prepare them for the job market, or move into further education, are not in the classroom, making it less likely that they will have a positive impact on their countries\u2019 development.\nImproving youth\u2019s future prospects for decent work helps break the intergenerational cycle of poverty and is beneficial for entire communities. To do so, it is crucial that adolescents understand money, resources and the markets that increasingly affect them, as they become consumers, workers and active citizens. This greatly improves their prospects for the future, as it prepares young people for a complex and turbulent job market.\n\nthis context, Aflatoun will roll out its Aflateen+ programme in Mozambique through its partnership with implementing organization Wona Sanana (WS).\nWona Sanana (WS) is a Mozambique-based organization dedicated to Child Protection and Education through providing technical assistance to local actors focusing on youth and education, and through advocating for the involvement of government agencies to ensure inclusive education and child protection policies.\nAflateen+ is a comprehensive educational programme to transform the lives of adolescent girls and boys aged 14-19 through social and financial education, and entrepreneurship with a gender lens. The programme\u2019s biggest strength is its flexibility to adapt to the local needs of the girls and boys, while offering a variety of lessons on life skills, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and financial empowerment. Throughout the lessons, the connection between gender equality and economic prosperity is emphasized. The project\u2019s overall objective is\nTo socially and economically empower young girls and boys (ages of 14 to 19) in Mozambique by providing them with the social and financial skills necessary to make informed choices about their health, financial situation, and education.\n\n\nImpact assessment\n\nTo assess the impact of the Aflateen+ programme on adolescent girls and boys in Mozambique, this research will use a mixed-method approach, with a heavy quantitative component. The study will collect and evaluate quantitative data through a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) and qualitative data from e.g. Most Significant Change or Focus Group Discussions.\nThe main question of the research is: What is the effect of the Aflateen+ programme among participants of the Aflateen+ programme, relative to the representative control sample in Mozambique?\nSince the project runs over three years, we aim to not only measure knowledge, awareness and attitudes of adolescent girls and boys, but also assess the impact of the programme on SDG outcome and impact indicators like school retention/attendance/drop-out, teenage pregnancy, gender based violence, and HIV-risk behaviour.\n\n\nCapacity assessment\n\nIn order to assess the effectiveness of the capacity building component of the project, the research will include two tools assessing the capacity of both trained partners/NGOs, as well as trained teachers/educators.\nAdding to that, as a follow up to the training of teachers, weekly push messages will be sent to the teachers or trainers via SMS or social media platforms. These messages may be questions or surveys on the progress of Aflateen+ activities. Additionally, micro content that reinforces learning, or guides teaching activities will be shared.\nThe evidence generated through this study will assist in regional advocacy and Aflatoun\u2019s engagement with regional bodies like SADC and the African Union, which will contribute to our efforts towards education system change.\n\n\nExperience requirements\nResearch institute/consultants should have:\n1.

As a PhD student you are supervised by research staff at TNO and academic staff at TU Delft. You will have the opportunity to collaborate on the technologically challenging projects of the Wind Energy research group at TNO and be part of the Department of Aerodynamics, Wind Energy and Propulsion of the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering of the TU Delft. You will also be part of the Graduate School of the TU Delft.\n\nThe quest for robust and higher power output at reduced costs per offshore wind turbine drives the design towards increasingly larger rotor diameters that have positive influence on the usage of the electrical grid (by larger capacity factor) and wind farm power production. To counter the increased mechanical loading in extreme off-design conditions these increasingly larger rotors have relatively small solidity. The much slender rotors therefore have to be equipped with thicker rotor blades. The drawback of thicker blade sections is their use is accompanied with large uncertainties in performance. This is motivating the application of vortex generators (VG) and thick trailing edges.\n\nVGs are commonly used on wind turbine blades to avoid early separation of flow which helps not only to increase the lift but also delays the stall leading to increased blade robustness. Delaying the stall angle of wind turbine blades will allow for operation over larger range of angle of attacks and thus increase power production from wind turbines. Although effects of VGs are studied by various researchers a model depicting the effects of these devices in an aerodynamic design tool is important to design state of the art airfoil sections/wind turbine blades. Furthermore, this project aims to investigate and model the effects of VGs in unsteady flow conditions, which is a challenging new research topic.\n\nIn this project we will approximate the effects of the VGs on the 2-D unsteady boundary layers so that it can be modelled as additional mixing in the fast and accurate aerodynamic design tools based on integral boundary layer equations (e.g. RFoil). The presence of a new shear layer will lead to additional viscous dissipation and affect the wall shear stress. To model these effects, new terms are introduced into the integral boundary layer equations to account for the extra mass and momentum flux and turbulence production. Both TNO and TUDelft have developed preliminary models to account for these effects and these models will be integrated.\n\nAbout TNO\nTNO is an independent research organisation that functions as a bridge between the worlds of academia and industry, and the public sector. TNO has around 3,500 employees working within nine domains for a wide range of clients, such as government agencies, the SME sector, civil society organisations, larger companies and service providers. We aim to translate research findings into straightforward applications and innovations to solve the challenges the world will encounter the day after tomorrow. We take the time to think calmly and thoroughly about issues and, once a project has been completed, we continue our search for tools, models and recommendations that will benefit our clients and society as a whole in the future.\nRead more about TNO as an employer\nWhat do we require of you?\nYou have a good set of brains, a passion for renewable energy in general and wind energy in particular, and great social skills. After all, you will always be working with others, as part of project teams or larger consortiums to solve societal issues. You don\u2019t have to know everything about the entire field (although we wouldn\u2019t mind it if you did). The most important thing is that you have a broad interest in applied scientific research and a passion for wind energy and similar topics. You\u2019re also not afraid to get out of your comfort zone and are eager to develop further.\n\nOther qualifications we\u2019re looking for:\nAn MSc degree in Aerospace Engineering from a well-established university, or an MSc degree in related engineering disciplines such as applied physics, applied mathematics, or mechanical engineering with a proven experience (courses, projects, work experience) in the field of computational fluid mechanics.\nA combination of good mathematical/analytical skills and a strong interest in high-fidelity numerical simulations is required.\nExperience with CFD methods (such as SU2, OpenFOAM) is preferred.\nProven experience with such simulations and related data processing is advantageous for this position.\nSince an important part of research work is dissemination and collaboration, fluent communication skills, both written and orally, in English are of utmost importance.\nFemale scientists are particularly encouraged to apply.\nThe research will start with a literature survey on the vortex generators (VGs) and modelling concepts for the higher and lower fidelity methods including the mathematical model developed by TNO. Previous experimental study and numerical (CFD) simulations will give an insight about the VGs and the model.\n\nAs a next main task CFD simulations (with an open source tool, e.g. SU2, OpenFOAM) will be performed on airfoil sections with and without VGs to construct the model data and the extend the original model. The first milestone will be implementing the steady VG model in RFOIL. This study will be supported by experimental data provided by partners of the project. The experiments will also contain information about unsteady flow conditions. The effect of these unsteady flow conditions in combination of VGs will be evaluated. A new set of innovative airfoil sections will be designed in various thicknesses that are optimized for VGs and thick trailing edges.\n\nAs the final main task of the research the PhD student will investigate the existing BAY VG model(s) as implemented in the open source CFD tools (e.g. OpenFOAM) and improve this model for the unsteady flow conditions. In order to see the effects of the VGs on the 3D flow, numerical simulations will be performed for relevant Reynolds numbers both with the BAY model and body fitted mesh. The unsteady velocity field will be analysed to get a better insight of the flow field. A new innovative blade will be designed including the effects of vortex generators. In the blade design the airfoil sections designed previously will be used.\n\nReferences\n1. https://doi.org/10.1002/we.2191\n2. https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2019-0803\n3. https://doi.org/10.4233/uuid:99b15acb-e25e-4cd9-8541-1e4056c1baed\n4. https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033788\n5. https://doi.org/10.1002/we.2204\n\nView Marcelien Bos-de Koning's vlog about wind energy at the North Sea.\nWhat can you expect of your work situation?\nWithin TNO, you\u2019ll be part of the Wind Energy research group, which is part of the Unit Energy Transition.

The candidate should be available in February \u2013April 2021 and December 2022 \u2013 February 2023.\nDeadline for submitting proposals: Monday 25 January 2021\n\n\nBackground\n\nAflatoun International is a non-profit organization, which offers social and financial education to children and young people worldwide, empowering them to make a positive change for a more equitable world. Aflatoun creates high-quality curricula, for different age groups, which are contextualized to local needs and specific circumstances. In 2019, Aflatoun reached 10.5 million children in 108 countries through over 345 partner organizations.\nAflatoun programs inspire children to discover their talents and put them to use, to stand up for their rights and those of their communities, to play games, and to solve problems. They learn how to save, how to budget, and how to set up social and financial enterprises that benefit themselves, their families, and their communities.\nAflatoun has been identified as a best in practice organisation by The Brookings Institution in the report 'Can We Leapfrog? The Potential of Education Innovations to Rapidly Accelerate Progress\u2019. The report presents a forward path in global education by examining the possibility of using innovations to \u2018leapfrog\u2019, rapidly accelerating educational progress to ensure that all young people develop the skills they need to thrive in a fast-changing world. Additionally, in 2019, HundrED Connect officially recognized Aflatoun as one of top 5 Spotlight Innovators for its work on financial education. HundrED Connect is an initiative that aims to improve education and inspire a movement by encouraging pedagogically sound and ambitious innovations to spread across the world. Aflatoun was also selected as an official Vanguard Member of the Million Lives Club, which celebrates innovators and social entrepreneurs who are reaching new horizons of impact and improving the lives of those living on less than $5 a day, and who have already scaled to serve at least 1,000,000 people.\n\n\nProject information\nWhile significant progress has been made towards universal primary school attendance, the reality is that a third (34%) of children of lower secondary school age (12-14 years) and more than half (58%) of 15 to 17-year-olds in sub-Saharan Africa are not in school. Hence, majority of those who should be acquiring the skills to prepare them for the job market, or move into further education, are not in the classroom, making it less likely that they will have a positive impact on their countries\u2019 development.\nImproving youth\u2019s future prospects for decent work helps break the intergenerational cycle of poverty and is beneficial for entire communities. To do so, it is crucial that adolescents understand money, resources and the markets that increasingly affect them, as they become consumers, workers and active citizens. This greatly improves their prospects for the future, as it prepares young people for a complex and turbulent job market.\n\nIn this light, Aflatoun will roll out its Aflateen+ programme in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire through its partnership with implementing organization Inades Formation.\nInades Formation is a Pan-African, non-profit organisation currently operating from field offices across 10 African countries. Their aim is to promote social and economic development of rural populations through stimulating and supporting development alternatives within rural communities. The organization conducts citizen-based advocacy work aimed at contributing towards the development of shared values for living together, rules of governance and policies for the common good.\nAflateen+ is a comprehensive educational programme to transform the lives of adolescent girls and boys aged 14-19 through social and financial education, and entrepreneurship with a gender lens. The programme\u2019s biggest strength is its flexibility to adapt to the local needs of the girls and boys, while offering a variety of lessons on life skills, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and financial empowerment. Throughout the lessons, the connection between gender equality and economic prosperity is emphasized. The project\u2019s overall objective is\nTo socially and economically empower young girls and boys (ages of 14 to 19) in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire by providing them with the social and financial skills necessary to make informed choices about their health, financial situation, and education.\n\n\nImpact assessment\n\nTo assess the impact of the Aflateen+ programme on adolescent girls and boys in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, this research will use a mixed-method approach, with a heavy quantitative component. The study will collect and evaluate quantitative data through a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) and qualitative data from e.g. Most Significant Change or Focus Group Discussions.\nThe main question of the research is: What is the effect of the Aflateen+ programme among participants of the Aflateen+ programme, relative to the representative control sample in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire?\nSince the project runs over three years, we aim to not only measure knowledge, awareness and attitudes of adolescent girls and boys, but also assess the impact of the programme on SDG outcome and impact indicators like school retention/attendance/drop-out, teenage pregnancy, gender based violence, and HIV-risk behaviour.\n\n\nCapacity assessment\n\nIn order to assess the effectiveness of the capacity building component of the project, the research will include two tools assessing the capacity of both trained partners/NGOs, as well as trained teachers/educators.\nAdding to that, as a follow up to the training of teachers, weekly push messages will be sent to the teachers or trainers via SMS or social media platforms. These messages may be questions or surveys on the progress of Aflateen+ activities. Additionally, micro content that reinforces learning, or guides teaching activities will be shared.\nThe evidence generated through this study will assist in regional advocacy and Aflatoun\u2019s engagement with regional bodies like SADC and the African Union, which will contribute to our efforts towards education system change.\n\nExperience requirements\nResearch institute/consultants should have:\n1.

The candidate should be available in February \u2013 April 2021 and December 2022 \u2013 February 2023.\n\nDeadline for submitting proposals: Monday 25 January 2021\n\n\nBackground\nAflatoun International is a non-profit organization, which offers social and financial education to children and young people worldwide, empowering them to make a positive change for a more equitable world. Aflatoun creates high-quality curricula, for different age groups, which are contextualized to local needs and specific circumstances. In 2019, Aflatoun reached 10.5 million children in 108 countries through over 345 partner organizations.\nAflatoun programs inspire children to discover their talents and put them to use, to stand up for their rights and those of their communities, to play games, and to solve problems. They learn how to save, how to budget, and how to set up social and financial enterprises that benefit themselves, their families, and their communities.\nAflatoun has been identified as a best in practice organisation by The Brookings Institution in the report 'Can We Leapfrog? The Potential of Education Innovations to Rapidly Accelerate Progress\u2019. The report presents a forward path in global education by examining the possibility of using innovations to \u2018leapfrog\u2019, rapidly accelerating educational progress to ensure that all young people develop the skills they need to thrive in a fast-changing world. Additionally, in 2019, HundrED Connect officially recognized Aflatoun as one of top 5 Spotlight Innovators for its work on financial education. HundrED Connect is an initiative that aims to improve education and inspire a movement by encouraging pedagogically sound and ambitious innovations to spread across the world. Aflatoun was also selected as an official Vanguard Member of the Million Lives Club, which celebrates innovators and social entrepreneurs who are reaching new horizons of impact and improving the lives of those living on less than $5 a day, and who have already scaled to serve at least 1,000,000 people.\n\n\nProject information\nWhile significant progress has been made towards universal primary school attendance, the reality is that a third (34%) of children of lower secondary school age (12-14 years) and more than half (58%) of 15 to 17-year-olds in sub-Saharan Africa are not in school. Hence, majority of those who should be acquiring the skills to prepare them for the job market, or move into further education, are not in the classroom, making it less likely that they will have a positive impact on their countries\u2019 development.\nImproving youth\u2019s future prospects for decent work helps break the intergenerational cycle of poverty and is beneficial for entire communities. To do so, it is crucial that adolescents understand money, resources and the markets that increasingly affect them, as they become consumers, workers and active citizens. This greatly improves their prospects for the future, as it prepares young people for a complex and turbulent job market.\n\nIn this context, Aflatoun will roll out its Aflateen+ programme in Zimbabwe through its partnership with implementing organization Junior Achievement Zimbabwe. Junior Achievement Zimbabwe is a not-for-profit organization aiming to prepare and inspire young people to value free enterprise, business, economics and entrepreneurship.\nAflateen+ is a comprehensive educational programme to transform the lives of adolescent girls and boys aged 14-19 through social and financial education, and entrepreneurship with a gender lens. The programme\u2019s biggest strength is its flexibility to adapt to the local needs of the girls and boys, while offering a variety of lessons on life skills, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and financial empowerment. Throughout the lessons, the connection between gender equality and economic prosperity is emphasized. The project\u2019s overall objective is\nTo socially and economically empower young girls and boys (ages of 14 to 19) in Zimbabwe by providing them with the social and financial skills necessary to make informed choices about their health, financial situation, and education.\n\n\nImpact assessment\n\nTo assess the impact of the Aflateen+ programme on adolescent girls and boys in Zimbabwe, this research will use a mixed-method approach, with a heavy quantitative component. The study will collect and evaluate quantitative data through a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) and qualitative data from e.g. Most Significant Change or Focus Group Discussions.\nThe main question of the research is: What is the effect of the Aflateen+ programme among participants of the Aflateen+ programme, relative to the representative control sample in Zimbabwe?\nSince the project runs over three years, we aim to not only measure knowledge, awareness and attitudes of adolescent girls and boys, but also assess the impact of the programme on SDG outcome and impact indicators like school retention/attendance/drop-out, teenage pregnancy, gender based violence, and HIV-risk behaviour.\n\n\nCapacity assessment\nIn order to assess the effectiveness of the capacity building component of the project, the research will include two tools assessing the capacity of both trained partners/NGOs, as well as trained teachers/educators.\nAdding to that, as a follow up to the training of teachers, weekly push messages will be sent to the teachers or trainers via SMS or social media platforms. These messages may be questions or surveys on the progress of Aflateen+ activities. Additionally, micro content that reinforces learning, or guides teaching activities will be shared.\nThe evidence generated through this study will assist in regional advocacy and Aflatoun\u2019s engagement with regional bodies like SADC and the African Union, which will contribute to our efforts towards education system change.\n\n\nExperience requirements\nResearch institute/consultants should have:\n1.
