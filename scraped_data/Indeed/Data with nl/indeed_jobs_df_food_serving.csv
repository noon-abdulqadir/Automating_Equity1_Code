20,food serving,Indeed,p_12ed3a6804310c20,hospitality night ambassador Amsterdam,citizenM, Amsterdam,"hello fellow mobile citizens,

What a year 2020 has been! Now, in 2021 - and with the vaccine around the corner - we are excited to begin looking ahead and truly hope the world will open up soon. Unfortunately, we do not have a crystal ball to tell us exactly when this will happen but one thing we do know for sure: we want to be ready. This is where YOU come in…

In preparation for the excitement 2021 is sure to bring, we are opening our night ambassador job posting now so that we can get in touch and stay in touch with YOU! While the exact start date of this position is still a bit uncertain, we want to start the conversation now so that we can connect you with the opportunities we have available as soon as the time is right. (OR: 2020 has taught us all a lot about uncertainty. We don’t want uncertainty to get in the way of connecting you with opportunities we have available which is why we’d like to start the conversation now.)

citizenM is a hotel providing affordable luxury for the mobile citizens of the world. With style that'll knock your socks off, we offer citizens a real home from home, plus the world’s fluffiest pillows. Our typical guest is a frequent traveler who is quality and design driven, and cost conscious.

We currently have hotels in Amsterdam, London, Copenhagen, New York and Paris, with more to come in Europe, the US and Asia. We are proud to have put the hospitality back into the hospitality industry, and have received numerous awards for our groundbreaking approach.

Why working for us is different
We won’t put you in a box as a ‘receptionist’ or ‘food and beverage’ person. With us, you’ll become a champion multitasker – customer service, receptionist, concierge, barista, mixologist, logistics and more. You will be a citizenM ambassador, free to be yourself to do the best job you can. We believe in making work fun. If you’re having a great experience, so will our guests. We promise we’ll never ask you to wear a silly bellboy hat.

We’re proud to put hospitality back in the hospitality industry, and that’s because of our ambassadors. We don’t hire them for their skills; we hire them for their attitude. We seek people who feel great about making people smile. You see the results in the rave reviews we receive online.

Your typical citizenM shift could include:

Making sure everyone gets a warm welcome as soon as they walk in
Helping guests at the self check-in kiosks (we have no reception desk)
Serving hot and cold local food (yes, even open sandwiches and herring)
Brewing delicious coffee or mixing a signature cocktail
Being a secret concierge to the city, answering guests’ questions about the best places to visit, eat, shop or party
Maintaining the living room, canteen, and arranging food displays for the following day

Typical shifts are: 23.00 - 07.00

Do you have what we’re looking for?
As we said before, you don’t need to come with experience in the hospitality industry, but you do need to come with the right attitude.

To be a successful at citizenM, you’ll need to have:

A genuine touch: Treat all people as you would treat your best friends.
A passionate attitude: Be optimistic and positive. You like to surprise and make people smile.
A contemporary style: You’re inspired by design and creativity, and love to use technology to simplify your life.
And you’ll need to be:

A smart thinker: You thrive on turning traditional thinking on its head and want to do things right the first time.
Really caring: You want to do the right thing for our guests, your colleagues, community and for the planet.
Fluent in English: It’s the way of the world. Other language abilities are welcome too!

What’s in it for you?
You’ll be joining a team of ambassadors who are proud to put on their citizenM outfit every day and go out to wow our guests. You’ll help us shake up the traditional hotel industry by providing the thing our guests love most about us: exceptional service.

You’ll take responsibility for your own success and you’ll be rewarded for your individual contribution. We’ll help you develop with a specialised training program and help you grow with a personal development plan (with potential for international travel, management opportunities, and work at the support office in the Netherlands).

Whether you’re interested in building a career in hospitality, or want to strike a balance between work and your other interests, we are the right place if you have a genuine passion for helping people, whatever your background.

citizenM loves diversity. We are an equal opportunity employer and welcome applications from anyone.

If you want to help redefine the world of hospitality for today’s mobile citizens, then we’d love to see you at one of our casting days. Apply now!

Je bent verantwoordelijk voor alle activiteiten binnen de ontbijtafdeling en speelt een sleutelrol in het leveren van de lunchservice. Je bent goed in het organiseren en het behouden van overzicht terwijl je dagelijks rond de 500 tot 950 couverts serveert.

Naast onze geweldige locatie, direct naast het Centraal Station, hebben wij natuurlijk nog veel meer te bieden. Gezien wij werken met een groot, maar daardoor niet minder samenhorig team, kunnen wij veel flexibiliteit bieden in het werk alsmede de uren. Door aan te sluiten bij ons ontbijtteam, zul je deel gaan uitmaken van een altijd vrolijk, dynamisch en vooral vriendelijk team dat je welkom zal laten voelen vanaf de eerste dag!

Altijd al willen werken in het grootste hotel in het centrum van Amsterdam?

DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station biedt prachtige uitzichten, buitengewone service en bruisende food & beverage outlets.

In ons hotel vind je SkyLounge Amsterdam, award-winning rooftop terras, pop-up restaurant Eastwood Beer & Grill, onze eigen Starbucks® store en het meest gevarieerde ontbijtbuffet van de stad. Natuurlijk krijg jij in al onze outlets 50% korting! Daarnaast kun jij naast je baan onbeperkt fit blijven. Onze fitness is namelijk 24/7 beschikbaar voor jou!

Als Breakfast Supervisor zul je deel uitmaken van onze ontbijt familie en werken in een zeer divers team, bestaande uit nationaliteiten van over de hele wereld. Deze diversiteit zal zich niet enkel tot het team limiteren, maar uit zichzelf ook in de gasten die je zult helpen alsmede het werk dat je zal gaan doen. Dit werk zal bestaan uit het effectief managen van de ontbijtservice, hierbij leg je de focus op snelheid en continuïteit in service.


Je assisteert de Breakfast Manager bij het behalen van targets, efficiënte kostenbeheersing en het maximaliseren van de omzet. Goede mensenkennis is essentieel; je helpt dan ook alle ontbijtmedewerkers om hun volle potentie te bereiken. Je bent verantwoordelijk voor alle activiteiten binnen de ontbijtafdeling en speelt een sleutelrol in het leveren van de lunchservice. Je bent goed in het organiseren en het behouden van overzicht terwijl je dagelijks rond de 500 tot 950 couverts serveert.

Naast onze geweldige locatie, direct naast het Centraal Station, hebben wij natuurlijk nog veel meer te bieden. Gezien wij werken met een groot, maar daardoor niet minder samenhorig team, kunnen wij veel flexibiliteit bieden in het werk alsmede de uren. Door aan te sluiten bij ons ontbijtteam, zul je deel gaan uitmaken van een altijd vrolijk, dynamisch en vooral vriendelijk team dat je welkom zal laten voelen vanaf de eerste dag!

En, voor wij het vergeten, naast de vele faciliteiten binnen ons hotel kun je zelf natuurlijk ook genieten van de Hilton service, wereldwijd en met korting!

Philips’ Domestic Appliances business is a global leader with EUR 2.3 billion in sales in 2019 in kitchen appliances, coffee, garment care and home care appliances, with successful products such as the Airfryer, Perfect Care Steam Generators, Automatic Coffee Machines with LatteGo and SpeedPro Max Aqua vacuum cleaner, and many more that are used by millions of people every day across the world.
In January 2020, Philips announced that it would be considering new ownership options for Domestic Appliances, as it is not a strategic fit for the company’s future as a health technology leader, and committed to finding the right home for the business to ensure that it is set up for continued success serving customers, leveraging the Philips brand and driving growth across the markets that it serves.
In its 128-year history as a leading innovator, Philips has had to reinvent itself a number of times to remain competitive. This has involved several high-profile divestments, resulting in the company’s successful track record in managing complex change of this scale. Such transformations offer unique opportunities for employees to ‘make their mark’ and gain expertise in a specific and dynamic environment - those who can deliver results while navigating and contributing to changes will gain unique skills and perspective that will prove valuable for the rest of their careers.
