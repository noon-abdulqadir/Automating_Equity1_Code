We aspire to have a workplace that reflects all of the diverse communities we serve and we welcome and encourage candidates from all backgrounds and experiences to apply for roles on our team. We work to cultivate an inclusive culture in which all of our employees can be their authentic selves.\nWhy join the Legal & Public Affairs Team now?\n\nBooking.com\u2019s Legal & Public Affairs team is on a transformational journey (think: growth, innovation, changes to how we operate); you will have an opportunity to actively shape the Department\u2019s future. We are also growing to enable Booking.com\u2019s strategy of the Connected Trip (a travel experience that includes not just accommodation, but also transportation, attractions, experiences, payments, flights etc).\n\nThis is a journey that requires close business and Legal & Public Affairs partnerships to navigate complex regulatory environments, build new products, and negotiate increasingly elaborate commercial deals, among other important projects our teams get involved every day. To tackle this mission, it all starts with a strong team passionate about growing Booking.com in an ethical and sustainable way!\n\nWho we are\n\nTo match our global footprint and the array of challenges we face, we are proud to highlight the diversity that exists across this group. We are a team of approximately 70 professionals - representing more than 20 nationalities - with lawyers qualified in many different countries, as well as non-lawyers with public policy, economics, compliance and risk backgrounds. Our team\u2019s previous experience spans across a multitude of industries with team members having worked for major global companies (including Uber, Amex, Airbnb, Amazon, Google, Nokia), tech and other startups, government entities (e.g., the Dutch Competition Authority), and reputable international law firms (e.g., Hogan Lovells, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, Baker Mckenzie), and Public Affairs firms (e.g., FTI Consulting, FIPRA, Brunswick).\n\nIn addition to our day-to-day work, we actively seek opportunities for our team members to engage in the wider global legal and public affairs communities through speaking engagements, training programs, and association memberships. Some of our lawyers are Board members of Consumer Law associations, Competition Law associations, Privacy associations, etc. We also truly believe in engaging with stakeholders to share our insights on policies affecting the travel experience and how travel tech innovations can fuel the digital transformation of the travel industry. For example, we recently launched Booking.com\u2019s Public Affairs blog, where we publish our position on key policy issues (A World Worth Experiencing).\n\nAs a team, we believe in:\n\nIntegrating with the Business and having a \u201cseat at the table\u201d: we are decision makers that can have a real impact on Booking.com\u2019s future\nBooking\u2019s mission of making it easier for everyone to experience the world.

We aspire to have a workplace that reflects all of the diverse communities we serve and we welcome and encourage candidates from all backgrounds and experiences to apply for roles on our team. We work to cultivate an inclusive culture in which all of our employees can be their authentic selves.\nWhy join the Legal & Public Affairs Team now?\n\nBooking.com\u2019s Legal & Public Affairs team is on a transformational journey (think: growth, innovation, changes to how we operate); you will have an opportunity to actively shape the Department\u2019s future. We are also growing to enable Booking.com\u2019s strategy of the Connected Trip (a travel experience that includes not just accommodation, but also transportation, attractions, experiences, payments, flights etc).\n\nThis is a journey that requires close business and Legal & Public Affairs partnerships to navigate complex regulatory environments, build new products, and negotiate increasingly elaborate commercial deals, among other important projects our teams get involved every day. To tackle this mission, it all starts with a strong team passionate about growing Booking.com in an ethical and sustainable way!\n\nWho we are\n\nTo match our global footprint and the array of challenges we face, we are proud to highlight the diversity that exists across this group. We are a team of approximately 70 professionals - representing more than 20 nationalities - with lawyers qualified in many different countries, as well as non-lawyers with public policy, economics, compliance and risk backgrounds. Our team\u2019s previous experience spans across a multitude of industries with team members having worked for major global companies (including Uber, Amex, Airbnb, Amazon, Google, Nokia), tech and other startups, government entities (e.g., the Dutch Competition Authority), and reputable international law firms (e.g., Hogan Lovells, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, Baker Mckenzie), and Public Affairs firms (e.g., FTI Consulting, FIPRA, Brunswick).\n\nIn addition to our day-to-day work, we actively seek opportunities for our team members to engage in the wider global legal and public affairs communities through speaking engagements, training programs, and association memberships. Some of our lawyers are Board members of Consumer Law associations, Competition Law associations, Privacy associations, etc. We also truly believe in engaging with stakeholders to share our insights on policies affecting the travel experience and how travel tech innovations can fuel the digital transformation of the travel industry. For example, we recently launched Booking.com\u2019s Public Affairs blog, where we publish our position on key policy issues (A World Worth Experiencing).\n\nAs a team, we believe in:\n\nIntegrating with the Business and having a \u201cseat at the table\u201d: we are decision makers that can have a real impact on Booking.com\u2019s future\nBooking\u2019s mission of making it easier for everyone to experience the world.
