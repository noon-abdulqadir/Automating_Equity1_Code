Introduction

Gain excellent hands-on research experience in a private Costa Rica nature reserve. This project is dedicated to teaching visitors more about the local wildlife and environment, aiding in conservation efforts. Education and research plays a huge role in the reserve, which is where your project proves invaluable.

Students, graduates and professionals are all welcome to apply. You will gain great conservation research experience while immersing yourself in the natural landscape of the majestic Talamanca mountains. There are 400 species of vertebrates living within the reserve, 15 of which are listed on the IUCN red list of threatened species.

You will be trained how to conduct research which can be used for conservation purposes, along with the general protection of rainforests and the reserve. Working alongside a passionate and educated team, you are required to commit to the placement for at least 10 weeks.

For more skilled applicants, you will conduct research into cloud forest ecosystems, reforestation, and/or the flora and fauna of the area. For those just starting out in research, as a research assistant, you can support studies from scientists from all around the world and/or take on responsibility for some of our smaller ongoing research projects. As the reserves reforestation project was such a success, less work is now required on planting trees. Instead, more effort is now being placed into research and education.

The reserve is hoping to start publishing its research results within scientific journals. They study a wide variety of topics including geology, forestry, climatology, biology, sociology and ecology. The reserves location is largely understudied, giving the opportunity for researchers to make new, exciting discoveries along the way.

This placement would best suit those who have practical or academic experience in research. If you do not, you may be better suited to our volunteer, rather than project placement.

Daily Life

You will typically be working 30 hours per week from Monday through to Friday, which equates to around 6 hours per day. However, hours can vary depending upon the type of project you are working on.

The tasks you carry out on a daily basis can also vary but will typically include conducting field work, maintaining in-depth field notes and inputting data results into computer records. You will work on 1-2 projects throughout the placement, with the option to undertake short-term or long-term studies, depending upon the length of your placement.

Potential projects you could end up working on include long-term camera trap deployment and monitoring of mammals. An example of a short-term project includes habitat assessments and setting live butterfly traps and sweep netting.

Examples of long-term potential projects include: tropical bird monitoring, camera trap deployment and monitoring of mammals, reforestation technique assessments, and tree inventory. Examples of previous short-term projects include: live butterfly trapping and sweep netting, effect of trail activity on bird behaviour, effect of introduced conifers on soil chemistry, and an assessment of the suitability of the reserve for reintroducing sloths.

Gain excellent hands-on research experience in a Costa Rican mountain cloud forest nature reserve. This project is dedicated to teaching visitors more about the local wildlife and environment, aiding in conservation efforts, and researching reforestation and the cloud forest environment. Education and research plays a huge role in the reserve, which is where your assistantship proves invaluable.

Students, graduates and professionals with a background in biology, forestry, or environmental sciences are all welcome to apply. You will gain valuable conservation research experience while immersing yourself in the natural landscape of the majestic Talamanca mountains. There are over 400 species of vertebrates living within the reserve, 15 of which are listed on the IUCN red list of threatened species.

You will be trained how to conduct research and assist research interns and researchers with their work, which can be used for conservation purposes, along with the general protection of rainforests and the reserve. Working alongside a passionate and educated team, you are required to commit to the placement for at least 4 weeks.

Research assistants assist the interns and researchers at the reserve with their work, which includes research into cloud forest ecosystems, reforestation, and/or the flora and fauna of the area, with the results being used to make management decisions and/or published within scientific journals. They study a wide variety of topics including biology, forestry, ecology, geology, climatology, and sociology. The reserves location is largely understudied, giving the opportunity for researchers to make new, exciting discoveries along the way.

This placement best suits those who have minimal practical or academic experience in research, but who want to gain experience or get exposed to a wide variety of survey techniques and topics; or those with previous research experience who cannot commit to the 10 week minimum required for a full research internship.

Some examples of projects research assistants have worked on include: camera trapping, bird surveys, reforestation success assessments, butterfly diversity, and animal and plant inventories. Research assistants are also sometimes put in charge of some of our smaller studies, like our monthly owl and bat surveys.

Daily Life

You will typically be working 30-40 hours per week from Monday through to Friday, which equates to around 6-8 hours per day. However, hours can vary depending upon the type of project you are working on. Depending on the need of the current research interns and researchers, you will be assigned to assist them with their work. Work assignments are rotated so that you will have the opportunity to work on most, if not all, of the different research being conducted at the reserve. The tasks you carry out on a daily basis will vary, but will typically include conducting field work, maintaining in-depth field notes, and inputting data results into computer records. Most of the year, it is sunny in the mornings and rains in the afternoons. As such, work starts at 7 am so that you can get back from the field before it starts to rain.

For leisure activities, the reserve and surrounding area has extensive trails to hike on (including a hike up the tallest mountain in Costa Rica), clear mountain rivers to swim in, frisbees and footballs to throw or kick around, board and card games, and a projector for movie nights. The reserve is also within walking distance of several restaurants, a fish farm where you can catch your dinner, a football pitch to play games on, and a thermal springs. A short car/bus ride down the mountain, there is a community which has cheese, chocolate, bread, and gelato makers; a bar with artisanal and local beer; and a butterfly garden. On the weekends, many assistants will take trips down the mountain to visit one of the many beach destinations available to swim and soak up the sun.

Mitigation and Adaptation in Latin America entered its third and new phase, 2016-2020. The new program EUROCLIMA+ promotes policy dialogue as well as provides technical and financial support to the development and implementation of climate change adaptation and mitigation policies in the Latin America region. It is designed to assist Latin American countries in the implementation of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. EUROCLIMA+ (EC+) addresses the needs in the following sectors considered by representatives of the region as of particular relevance for climate change:Forest, biodiversity and ecosystems;- Urban mobility;- Disaster risk reduction and management: drought and floods- Resilient food production;- Renewable energy and energy efficiency.- Water management in the context of urban resilience;- Climate governance (horizontal component)

with a

special focus on the promotion of NDC- Implementation and regional Cooperation The objective of the Resilient Food Production (RFP) component of the EUROCLIMA+ Programme is to finance and support initiatives that increase the climate resilience of sustainable agricultural production systems and agro-food chains in Latin America. The RFP component is jointly implemented by GIZ and Expertise France. The RFP component is structured around two implementation tools:- A Call for Proposals (CfP) in order to identify and co-finance innovative and relevant projects emanating from a wide range of stakeholders (governmental organizations, NGOs, research networks climate change national policies and plans) and the Sustainable Development Goals;- A dedicated Technical Assistance (TA), which is be flexible enough to ensure it addresses the priorities of the Latin American countries in general and of the projects funded through EUROCLIMA+. The Strategy and Action Plan of the Technical Assistance was defined in coordination with the Latin American counterparts participating in the Sector Working Group and the partner organizations who implement the co-funded projects. Five specific action lines were agreed upon:- Strengthening of management capacities of project implementing organizations.- Strengthening of technical capacities of project implementing organizations and synergies with other sectors of EC+.- Strengthening of climate governance capacities of the Resilient Food Production Sector.- Knowledge Management, Communication and Visibility.- Flexible support to complementary demands.The SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) capacity analysis at project and national food sector level concluded that there is an urgent need to strengthen basic capacities of key stakeholders like the National or Sector Focal Points (NFPs) and project implementing agencies on understanding and implementing NDCs in the food sector. By September 2019, NFPs confirmed the corresponding action proposed in the component’s Technical Assistance Strategy presented by Expertise France.Therefore, Expertise France will organize a TRAINING OF MULTIPLIERS ON THE FRAMEWORK AND IMPLEMENTATION OF NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PARIS AGREEMENT IN LATIN AMERICA, whose general objective is to strengthen capacities of key staff from National Focal Point (NFP) institutions and project implementing organizations, who shall gain a general overview and serve as multipliers on NDC implementation in the national food sector or a project context. By this means, they shall become more confident to communicate adequately on the foundations of climate change and the NDC framework, concepts of mitigation and adaptation under the NDC framework, the enhanced transparency framework and climate finance.

17,forestry,LinkedIn,2439707283,PhD fellow in Political Ecology of Natural Climate Solutions,-1,Amsterdam Area,-1,-1,"Department of Food and Resource Economics, Faculty of Science at University of Copenhagen is offering a PhD scholarship in Political Ecology of Natural Climate Solutions commencing 01.09.2021 or as soon as possible thereafter.

Description Of The Scientific Environment

The PhD study will be hosted by the Global Development group at the Department of Food and Resource Economics. This group constitutes 10 permanent staff, 5-6 post.docs/assistant professors and 8-10 PhD students and engages in inter-disciplinary research on economic, political, environmental, and institutional dynamics in developing and post-colonial societies. The Department of Food and Resource Economics has an excellent research environment with a well-functioning administrative section. The candidate will also collaborate with research project partners at Lund University and University of Melbourne.

The PhD study is part of a research project that examines the imaginaries embedded in and produced through Natural Climate Solutions. Theoretically, the project draws inspiration from the fields of political ecology and science studies. Empirically, it emphasizes narratives as the entry point to understand how Natural Climate Solutions (re-)produces ideas about past, present and future natures and nature-society relations. The project will examine, among other, narratives that promote and contest Natural Climate Solutions by actors across academia, policy, industry, and civil society, how different actors selectively mobilize research in Natural Climate Solutions narratives, and how on-the-ground policy implementation is translated into narratives of Natural Climate Solutions potential.

Project Description

The PhD study should contribute to one or more aspects of the overall research objectives of the project described above. Emphasis could, for instance, be placed on the ecological assumptions in studies estimating mitigation potentials of Natural Climate Solutions. Or on the implicit ideas about human-society relations embedded in narratives about Natural Climate Solutions floating on social media platforms. Or on the political economies enabled and obstructed by Natural Climate Solutions.
