Je hebt maar \u00e9\u00e9n keer de kans om de manier van werken echt optimaal in te richten. Nu nog met ca 50 \u2013 75 objecten, maar de ambities liggen bij een veelvoud van deze aantallen. En daar kan jij aan meebouwen, letterlijk ook. Als je nu al een netwerk hebt binnen de wereld van het Verhuur en Beheer, dan is dat uiteraard een pre, maar sowieso ben jij in staat om nieuwe klanten aan je te binden.
