The candidate should be available in February \u2013 April 2021 and December 2022 \u2013 February 2023.\n\nDeadline for submitting proposals: Monday 25 January 2021\n\n\nBackground\nAflatoun International is a non-profit organization, which offers social and financial education to children and young people worldwide, empowering them to make a positive change for a more equitable world. Aflatoun creates high-quality curricula, for different age groups, which are contextualized to local needs and specific circumstances. In 2019, Aflatoun reached 10.5 million children in 108 countries through over 345 partner organizations.\nAflatoun programs inspire children to discover their talents and put them to use, to stand up for their rights and those of their communities, to play games, and to solve problems. They learn how to save, how to budget, and how to set up social and financial enterprises that benefit themselves, their families, and their communities.\nAflatoun has been identified as a best in practice organisation by The Brookings Institution in the report 'Can We Leapfrog? The Potential of Education Innovations to Rapidly Accelerate Progress\u2019. The report presents a forward path in global education by examining the possibility of using innovations to \u2018leapfrog\u2019, rapidly accelerating educational progress to ensure that all young people develop the skills they need to thrive in a fast-changing world. Additionally, in 2019, HundrED Connect officially recognized Aflatoun as one of top 5 Spotlight Innovators for its work on financial education. HundrED Connect is an initiative that aims to improve education and inspire a movement by encouraging pedagogically sound and ambitious innovations to spread across the world. Aflatoun was also selected as an official Vanguard Member of the Million Lives Club, which celebrates innovators and social entrepreneurs who are reaching new horizons of impact and improving the lives of those living on less than $5 a day, and who have already scaled to serve at least 1,000,000 people.\n\n\nProject information\nWhile significant progress has been made towards universal primary school attendance, the reality is that a third (34%) of children of lower secondary school age (12-14 years) and more than half (58%) of 15 to 17-year-olds in sub-Saharan Africa are not in school. Hence, majority of those who should be acquiring the skills to prepare them for the job market, or move into further education, are not in the classroom, making it less likely that they will have a positive impact on their countries\u2019 development.\nImproving youth\u2019s future prospects for decent work helps break the intergenerational cycle of poverty and is beneficial for entire communities. To do so, it is crucial that adolescents understand money, resources and the markets that increasingly affect them, as they become consumers, workers and active citizens. This greatly improves their prospects for the future, as it prepares young people for a complex and turbulent job market.\n\nIn this context, Aflatoun will roll out its Aflateen+ programme in Zimbabwe through its partnership with implementing organization Junior Achievement Zimbabwe. Junior Achievement Zimbabwe is a not-for-profit organization aiming to prepare and inspire young people to value free enterprise, business, economics and entrepreneurship.\nAflateen+ is a comprehensive educational programme to transform the lives of adolescent girls and boys aged 14-19 through social and financial education, and entrepreneurship with a gender lens. The programme\u2019s biggest strength is its flexibility to adapt to the local needs of the girls and boys, while offering a variety of lessons on life skills, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and financial empowerment. Throughout the lessons, the connection between gender equality and economic prosperity is emphasized. The project\u2019s overall objective is\nTo socially and economically empower young girls and boys (ages of 14 to 19) in Zimbabwe by providing them with the social and financial skills necessary to make informed choices about their health, financial situation, and education.\n\n\nImpact assessment\n\nTo assess the impact of the Aflateen+ programme on adolescent girls and boys in Zimbabwe, this research will use a mixed-method approach, with a heavy quantitative component. The study will collect and evaluate quantitative data through a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) and qualitative data from e.g. Most Significant Change or Focus Group Discussions.\nThe main question of the research is: What is the effect of the Aflateen+ programme among participants of the Aflateen+ programme, relative to the representative control sample in Zimbabwe?\nSince the project runs over three years, we aim to not only measure knowledge, awareness and attitudes of adolescent girls and boys, but also assess the impact of the programme on SDG outcome and impact indicators like school retention/attendance/drop-out, teenage pregnancy, gender based violence, and HIV-risk behaviour.\n\n\nCapacity assessment\nIn order to assess the effectiveness of the capacity building component of the project, the research will include two tools assessing the capacity of both trained partners/NGOs, as well as trained teachers/educators.\nAdding to that, as a follow up to the training of teachers, weekly push messages will be sent to the teachers or trainers via SMS or social media platforms. These messages may be questions or surveys on the progress of Aflateen+ activities. Additionally, micro content that reinforces learning, or guides teaching activities will be shared.\nThe evidence generated through this study will assist in regional advocacy and Aflatoun\u2019s engagement with regional bodies like SADC and the African Union, which will contribute to our efforts towards education system change.\n\n\nExperience requirements\nResearch institute/consultants should have:\n1. Experience conducting Random Control Trials;\n2. Extensive experience with leading a team of researchers and data enumerators incl. training of data enumerators on the use of evaluation tools;\n3.

The candidate should be available in February \u2013 April 2021 and December 2022 \u2013 February 2023.\nDeadline for submitting proposals: Monday 25 January 2021\n\n\nBackground\n\nAflatoun International is a non-profit organization, which offers social and financial education to children and young people worldwide, empowering them to make a positive change for a more equitable world. Aflatoun creates high-quality curricula, for different age groups, which are contextualized to local needs and specific circumstances. In 2019, Aflatoun reached 10.5 million children in 108 countries through over 345 partner organizations.\nAflatoun programs inspire children to discover their talents and put them to use, to stand up for their rights and those of their communities, to play games, and to solve problems. They learn how to save, how to budget, and how to set up social and financial enterprises that benefit themselves, their families, and their communities.\nAflatoun has been identified as a best in practice organisation by The Brookings Institution in the report 'Can We Leapfrog? The Potential of Education Innovations to Rapidly Accelerate Progress\u2019. The report presents a forward path in global education by examining the possibility of using innovations to \u2018leapfrog\u2019, rapidly accelerating educational progress to ensure that all young people develop the skills they need to thrive in a fast-changing world. Additionally, in 2019, HundrED Connect officially recognized Aflatoun as one of top 5 Spotlight Innovators for its work on financial education. HundrED Connect is an initiative that aims to improve education and inspire a movement by encouraging pedagogically sound and ambitious innovations to spread across the world. Aflatoun was also selected as an official Vanguard Member of the Million Lives Club, which celebrates innovators and social entrepreneurs who are reaching new horizons of impact and improving the lives of those living on less than $5 a day, and who have already scaled to serve at least 1,000,000 people.\n\n\nProject information\n\nWhile significant progress has been made towards universal primary school attendance, the reality is that a third (34%) of children of lower secondary school age (12-14 years) and more than half (58%) of 15 to 17-year-olds in sub-Saharan Africa are not in school. Hence, majority of those who should be acquiring the skills to prepare them for the job market, or move into further education, are not in the classroom, making it less likely that they will have a positive impact on their countries\u2019 development.\nImproving youth\u2019s future prospects for decent work helps break the intergenerational cycle of poverty and is beneficial for entire communities. To do so, it is crucial that adolescents understand money, resources and the markets that increasingly affect them, as they become consumers, workers and active citizens. This greatly improves their prospects for the future, as it prepares young people for a complex and turbulent job market.\n\nthis context, Aflatoun will roll out its Aflateen+ programme in Mozambique through its partnership with implementing organization Wona Sanana (WS).\nWona Sanana (WS) is a Mozambique-based organization dedicated to Child Protection and Education through providing technical assistance to local actors focusing on youth and education, and through advocating for the involvement of government agencies to ensure inclusive education and child protection policies.\nAflateen+ is a comprehensive educational programme to transform the lives of adolescent girls and boys aged 14-19 through social and financial education, and entrepreneurship with a gender lens. The programme\u2019s biggest strength is its flexibility to adapt to the local needs of the girls and boys, while offering a variety of lessons on life skills, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and financial empowerment. Throughout the lessons, the connection between gender equality and economic prosperity is emphasized. The project\u2019s overall objective is\nTo socially and economically empower young girls and boys (ages of 14 to 19) in Mozambique by providing them with the social and financial skills necessary to make informed choices about their health, financial situation, and education.\n\n\nImpact assessment\n\nTo assess the impact of the Aflateen+ programme on adolescent girls and boys in Mozambique, this research will use a mixed-method approach, with a heavy quantitative component. The study will collect and evaluate quantitative data through a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) and qualitative data from e.g. Most Significant Change or Focus Group Discussions.\nThe main question of the research is: What is the effect of the Aflateen+ programme among participants of the Aflateen+ programme, relative to the representative control sample in Mozambique?\nSince the project runs over three years, we aim to not only measure knowledge, awareness and attitudes of adolescent girls and boys, but also assess the impact of the programme on SDG outcome and impact indicators like school retention/attendance/drop-out, teenage pregnancy, gender based violence, and HIV-risk behaviour.\n\n\nCapacity assessment\n\nIn order to assess the effectiveness of the capacity building component of the project, the research will include two tools assessing the capacity of both trained partners/NGOs, as well as trained teachers/educators.\nAdding to that, as a follow up to the training of teachers, weekly push messages will be sent to the teachers or trainers via SMS or social media platforms. These messages may be questions or surveys on the progress of Aflateen+ activities. Additionally, micro content that reinforces learning, or guides teaching activities will be shared.\nThe evidence generated through this study will assist in regional advocacy and Aflatoun\u2019s engagement with regional bodies like SADC and the African Union, which will contribute to our efforts towards education system change.\n\n\nExperience requirements\nResearch institute/consultants should have:\n1. Experience conducting Random Control Trials;\n\n2. Extensive experience with leading a team of researchers and data enumerators incl. training of data enumerators on the use of evaluation tools;\n3.

The candidate should be available in February \u2013April 2021 and December 2022 \u2013 February 2023.\nDeadline for submitting proposals: Monday 25 January 2021\n\n\nBackground\n\nAflatoun International is a non-profit organization, which offers social and financial education to children and young people worldwide, empowering them to make a positive change for a more equitable world. Aflatoun creates high-quality curricula, for different age groups, which are contextualized to local needs and specific circumstances. In 2019, Aflatoun reached 10.5 million children in 108 countries through over 345 partner organizations.\nAflatoun programs inspire children to discover their talents and put them to use, to stand up for their rights and those of their communities, to play games, and to solve problems. They learn how to save, how to budget, and how to set up social and financial enterprises that benefit themselves, their families, and their communities.\nAflatoun has been identified as a best in practice organisation by The Brookings Institution in the report 'Can We Leapfrog? The Potential of Education Innovations to Rapidly Accelerate Progress\u2019. The report presents a forward path in global education by examining the possibility of using innovations to \u2018leapfrog\u2019, rapidly accelerating educational progress to ensure that all young people develop the skills they need to thrive in a fast-changing world. Additionally, in 2019, HundrED Connect officially recognized Aflatoun as one of top 5 Spotlight Innovators for its work on financial education. HundrED Connect is an initiative that aims to improve education and inspire a movement by encouraging pedagogically sound and ambitious innovations to spread across the world. Aflatoun was also selected as an official Vanguard Member of the Million Lives Club, which celebrates innovators and social entrepreneurs who are reaching new horizons of impact and improving the lives of those living on less than $5 a day, and who have already scaled to serve at least 1,000,000 people.\n\n\nProject information\nWhile significant progress has been made towards universal primary school attendance, the reality is that a third (34%) of children of lower secondary school age (12-14 years) and more than half (58%) of 15 to 17-year-olds in sub-Saharan Africa are not in school. Hence, majority of those who should be acquiring the skills to prepare them for the job market, or move into further education, are not in the classroom, making it less likely that they will have a positive impact on their countries\u2019 development.\nImproving youth\u2019s future prospects for decent work helps break the intergenerational cycle of poverty and is beneficial for entire communities. To do so, it is crucial that adolescents understand money, resources and the markets that increasingly affect them, as they become consumers, workers and active citizens. This greatly improves their prospects for the future, as it prepares young people for a complex and turbulent job market.\n\nIn this light, Aflatoun will roll out its Aflateen+ programme in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire through its partnership with implementing organization Inades Formation.\nInades Formation is a Pan-African, non-profit organisation currently operating from field offices across 10 African countries. Their aim is to promote social and economic development of rural populations through stimulating and supporting development alternatives within rural communities. The organization conducts citizen-based advocacy work aimed at contributing towards the development of shared values for living together, rules of governance and policies for the common good.\nAflateen+ is a comprehensive educational programme to transform the lives of adolescent girls and boys aged 14-19 through social and financial education, and entrepreneurship with a gender lens. The programme\u2019s biggest strength is its flexibility to adapt to the local needs of the girls and boys, while offering a variety of lessons on life skills, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and financial empowerment. Throughout the lessons, the connection between gender equality and economic prosperity is emphasized. The project\u2019s overall objective is\nTo socially and economically empower young girls and boys (ages of 14 to 19) in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire by providing them with the social and financial skills necessary to make informed choices about their health, financial situation, and education.\n\n\nImpact assessment\n\nTo assess the impact of the Aflateen+ programme on adolescent girls and boys in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, this research will use a mixed-method approach, with a heavy quantitative component. The study will collect and evaluate quantitative data through a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) and qualitative data from e.g. Most Significant Change or Focus Group Discussions.\nThe main question of the research is: What is the effect of the Aflateen+ programme among participants of the Aflateen+ programme, relative to the representative control sample in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire?\nSince the project runs over three years, we aim to not only measure knowledge, awareness and attitudes of adolescent girls and boys, but also assess the impact of the programme on SDG outcome and impact indicators like school retention/attendance/drop-out, teenage pregnancy, gender based violence, and HIV-risk behaviour.\n\n\nCapacity assessment\n\nIn order to assess the effectiveness of the capacity building component of the project, the research will include two tools assessing the capacity of both trained partners/NGOs, as well as trained teachers/educators.\nAdding to that, as a follow up to the training of teachers, weekly push messages will be sent to the teachers or trainers via SMS or social media platforms. These messages may be questions or surveys on the progress of Aflateen+ activities. Additionally, micro content that reinforces learning, or guides teaching activities will be shared.\nThe evidence generated through this study will assist in regional advocacy and Aflatoun\u2019s engagement with regional bodies like SADC and the African Union, which will contribute to our efforts towards education system change.\n\nExperience requirements\nResearch institute/consultants should have:\n1.

The candidate should be available in February \u2013 April 2021 and December 2022 \u2013 February 2023.\n\nDeadline for submitting proposals: Monday 25 January 2021\n\n\nBackground\nAflatoun International is a non-profit organization, which offers social and financial education to children and young people worldwide, empowering them to make a positive change for a more equitable world. Aflatoun creates high-quality curricula, for different age groups, which are contextualized to local needs and specific circumstances. In 2019, Aflatoun reached 10.5 million children in 108 countries through over 345 partner organizations.\nAflatoun programs inspire children to discover their talents and put them to use, to stand up for their rights and those of their communities, to play games, and to solve problems. They learn how to save, how to budget, and how to set up social and financial enterprises that benefit themselves, their families, and their communities.\nAflatoun has been identified as a best in practice organisation by The Brookings Institution in the report 'Can We Leapfrog? The Potential of Education Innovations to Rapidly Accelerate Progress\u2019. The report presents a forward path in global education by examining the possibility of using innovations to \u2018leapfrog\u2019, rapidly accelerating educational progress to ensure that all young people develop the skills they need to thrive in a fast-changing world. Additionally, in 2019, HundrED Connect officially recognized Aflatoun as one of top 5 Spotlight Innovators for its work on financial education. HundrED Connect is an initiative that aims to improve education and inspire a movement by encouraging pedagogically sound and ambitious innovations to spread across the world. Aflatoun was also selected as an official Vanguard Member of the Million Lives Club, which celebrates innovators and social entrepreneurs who are reaching new horizons of impact and improving the lives of those living on less than $5 a day, and who have already scaled to serve at least 1,000,000 people.\n\n\nProject information\nWhile significant progress has been made towards universal primary school attendance, the reality is that a third (34%) of children of lower secondary school age (12-14 years) and more than half (58%) of 15 to 17-year-olds in sub-Saharan Africa are not in school. Hence, majority of those who should be acquiring the skills to prepare them for the job market, or move into further education, are not in the classroom, making it less likely that they will have a positive impact on their countries\u2019 development.\nImproving youth\u2019s future prospects for decent work helps break the intergenerational cycle of poverty and is beneficial for entire communities. To do so, it is crucial that adolescents understand money, resources and the markets that increasingly affect them, as they become consumers, workers and active citizens. This greatly improves their prospects for the future, as it prepares young people for a complex and turbulent job market.\n\nIn this context, Aflatoun will roll out its Aflateen+ programme in Zimbabwe through its partnership with implementing organization Junior Achievement Zimbabwe. Junior Achievement Zimbabwe is a not-for-profit organization aiming to prepare and inspire young people to value free enterprise, business, economics and entrepreneurship.\nAflateen+ is a comprehensive educational programme to transform the lives of adolescent girls and boys aged 14-19 through social and financial education, and entrepreneurship with a gender lens. The programme\u2019s biggest strength is its flexibility to adapt to the local needs of the girls and boys, while offering a variety of lessons on life skills, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and financial empowerment. Throughout the lessons, the connection between gender equality and economic prosperity is emphasized. The project\u2019s overall objective is\nTo socially and economically empower young girls and boys (ages of 14 to 19) in Zimbabwe by providing them with the social and financial skills necessary to make informed choices about their health, financial situation, and education.\n\n\nImpact assessment\n\nTo assess the impact of the Aflateen+ programme on adolescent girls and boys in Zimbabwe, this research will use a mixed-method approach, with a heavy quantitative component. The study will collect and evaluate quantitative data through a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) and qualitative data from e.g. Most Significant Change or Focus Group Discussions.\nThe main question of the research is: What is the effect of the Aflateen+ programme among participants of the Aflateen+ programme, relative to the representative control sample in Zimbabwe?\nSince the project runs over three years, we aim to not only measure knowledge, awareness and attitudes of adolescent girls and boys, but also assess the impact of the programme on SDG outcome and impact indicators like school retention/attendance/drop-out, teenage pregnancy, gender based violence, and HIV-risk behaviour.\n\n\nCapacity assessment\nIn order to assess the effectiveness of the capacity building component of the project, the research will include two tools assessing the capacity of both trained partners/NGOs, as well as trained teachers/educators.\nAdding to that, as a follow up to the training of teachers, weekly push messages will be sent to the teachers or trainers via SMS or social media platforms. These messages may be questions or surveys on the progress of Aflateen+ activities. Additionally, micro content that reinforces learning, or guides teaching activities will be shared.\nThe evidence generated through this study will assist in regional advocacy and Aflatoun\u2019s engagement with regional bodies like SADC and the African Union, which will contribute to our efforts towards education system change.\n\n\nExperience requirements\nResearch institute/consultants should have:\n1.

The candidate should be available in February \u2013 April 2021 and December 2022 \u2013 February 2023.\nDeadline for submitting proposals: Monday 25 January 2021\n\n\nBackground\n\nAflatoun International is a non-profit organization, which offers social and financial education to children and young people worldwide, empowering them to make a positive change for a more equitable world. Aflatoun creates high-quality curricula, for different age groups, which are contextualized to local needs and specific circumstances. In 2019, Aflatoun reached 10.5 million children in 108 countries through over 345 partner organizations.\nAflatoun programs inspire children to discover their talents and put them to use, to stand up for their rights and those of their communities, to play games, and to solve problems. They learn how to save, how to budget, and how to set up social and financial enterprises that benefit themselves, their families, and their communities.\nAflatoun has been identified as a best in practice organisation by The Brookings Institution in the report 'Can We Leapfrog? The Potential of Education Innovations to Rapidly Accelerate Progress\u2019. The report presents a forward path in global education by examining the possibility of using innovations to \u2018leapfrog\u2019, rapidly accelerating educational progress to ensure that all young people develop the skills they need to thrive in a fast-changing world. Additionally, in 2019, HundrED Connect officially recognized Aflatoun as one of top 5 Spotlight Innovators for its work on financial education. HundrED Connect is an initiative that aims to improve education and inspire a movement by encouraging pedagogically sound and ambitious innovations to spread across the world. Aflatoun was also selected as an official Vanguard Member of the Million Lives Club, which celebrates innovators and social entrepreneurs who are reaching new horizons of impact and improving the lives of those living on less than $5 a day, and who have already scaled to serve at least 1,000,000 people.\n\n\nProject information\n\nWhile significant progress has been made towards universal primary school attendance, the reality is that a third (34%) of children of lower secondary school age (12-14 years) and more than half (58%) of 15 to 17-year-olds in sub-Saharan Africa are not in school. Hence, majority of those who should be acquiring the skills to prepare them for the job market, or move into further education, are not in the classroom, making it less likely that they will have a positive impact on their countries\u2019 development.\nImproving youth\u2019s future prospects for decent work helps break the intergenerational cycle of poverty and is beneficial for entire communities. To do so, it is crucial that adolescents understand money, resources and the markets that increasingly affect them, as they become consumers, workers and active citizens. This greatly improves their prospects for the future, as it prepares young people for a complex and turbulent job market.\n\nthis context, Aflatoun will roll out its Aflateen+ programme in Mozambique through its partnership with implementing organization Wona Sanana (WS).\nWona Sanana (WS) is a Mozambique-based organization dedicated to Child Protection and Education through providing technical assistance to local actors focusing on youth and education, and through advocating for the involvement of government agencies to ensure inclusive education and child protection policies.\nAflateen+ is a comprehensive educational programme to transform the lives of adolescent girls and boys aged 14-19 through social and financial education, and entrepreneurship with a gender lens. The programme\u2019s biggest strength is its flexibility to adapt to the local needs of the girls and boys, while offering a variety of lessons on life skills, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and financial empowerment. Throughout the lessons, the connection between gender equality and economic prosperity is emphasized. The project\u2019s overall objective is\nTo socially and economically empower young girls and boys (ages of 14 to 19) in Mozambique by providing them with the social and financial skills necessary to make informed choices about their health, financial situation, and education.\n\n\nImpact assessment\n\nTo assess the impact of the Aflateen+ programme on adolescent girls and boys in Mozambique, this research will use a mixed-method approach, with a heavy quantitative component. The study will collect and evaluate quantitative data through a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) and qualitative data from e.g. Most Significant Change or Focus Group Discussions.\nThe main question of the research is: What is the effect of the Aflateen+ programme among participants of the Aflateen+ programme, relative to the representative control sample in Mozambique?\nSince the project runs over three years, we aim to not only measure knowledge, awareness and attitudes of adolescent girls and boys, but also assess the impact of the programme on SDG outcome and impact indicators like school retention/attendance/drop-out, teenage pregnancy, gender based violence, and HIV-risk behaviour.\n\n\nCapacity assessment\n\nIn order to assess the effectiveness of the capacity building component of the project, the research will include two tools assessing the capacity of both trained partners/NGOs, as well as trained teachers/educators.\nAdding to that, as a follow up to the training of teachers, weekly push messages will be sent to the teachers or trainers via SMS or social media platforms. These messages may be questions or surveys on the progress of Aflateen+ activities. Additionally, micro content that reinforces learning, or guides teaching activities will be shared.\nThe evidence generated through this study will assist in regional advocacy and Aflatoun\u2019s engagement with regional bodies like SADC and the African Union, which will contribute to our efforts towards education system change.\n\n\nExperience requirements\nResearch institute/consultants should have:\n1. Experience conducting Random Control Trials;\n\n2. Extensive experience with leading a team of researchers and data enumerators incl. training of data enumerators on the use of evaluation tools;\n3. Extensive experience in survey development and contextualisation;\n4. Experience with statistical analyses using statistical software such as STATA or R;\n5.

The candidate should be available in February \u2013April 2021 and December 2022 \u2013 February 2023.\nDeadline for submitting proposals: Monday 25 January 2021\n\n\nBackground\n\nAflatoun International is a non-profit organization, which offers social and financial education to children and young people worldwide, empowering them to make a positive change for a more equitable world. Aflatoun creates high-quality curricula, for different age groups, which are contextualized to local needs and specific circumstances. In 2019, Aflatoun reached 10.5 million children in 108 countries through over 345 partner organizations.\nAflatoun programs inspire children to discover their talents and put them to use, to stand up for their rights and those of their communities, to play games, and to solve problems. They learn how to save, how to budget, and how to set up social and financial enterprises that benefit themselves, their families, and their communities.\nAflatoun has been identified as a best in practice organisation by The Brookings Institution in the report 'Can We Leapfrog? The Potential of Education Innovations to Rapidly Accelerate Progress\u2019. The report presents a forward path in global education by examining the possibility of using innovations to \u2018leapfrog\u2019, rapidly accelerating educational progress to ensure that all young people develop the skills they need to thrive in a fast-changing world. Additionally, in 2019, HundrED Connect officially recognized Aflatoun as one of top 5 Spotlight Innovators for its work on financial education. HundrED Connect is an initiative that aims to improve education and inspire a movement by encouraging pedagogically sound and ambitious innovations to spread across the world. Aflatoun was also selected as an official Vanguard Member of the Million Lives Club, which celebrates innovators and social entrepreneurs who are reaching new horizons of impact and improving the lives of those living on less than $5 a day, and who have already scaled to serve at least 1,000,000 people.\n\n\nProject information\nWhile significant progress has been made towards universal primary school attendance, the reality is that a third (34%) of children of lower secondary school age (12-14 years) and more than half (58%) of 15 to 17-year-olds in sub-Saharan Africa are not in school. Hence, majority of those who should be acquiring the skills to prepare them for the job market, or move into further education, are not in the classroom, making it less likely that they will have a positive impact on their countries\u2019 development.\nImproving youth\u2019s future prospects for decent work helps break the intergenerational cycle of poverty and is beneficial for entire communities. To do so, it is crucial that adolescents understand money, resources and the markets that increasingly affect them, as they become consumers, workers and active citizens. This greatly improves their prospects for the future, as it prepares young people for a complex and turbulent job market.\n\nIn this light, Aflatoun will roll out its Aflateen+ programme in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire through its partnership with implementing organization Inades Formation.\nInades Formation is a Pan-African, non-profit organisation currently operating from field offices across 10 African countries. Their aim is to promote social and economic development of rural populations through stimulating and supporting development alternatives within rural communities. The organization conducts citizen-based advocacy work aimed at contributing towards the development of shared values for living together, rules of governance and policies for the common good.\nAflateen+ is a comprehensive educational programme to transform the lives of adolescent girls and boys aged 14-19 through social and financial education, and entrepreneurship with a gender lens. The programme\u2019s biggest strength is its flexibility to adapt to the local needs of the girls and boys, while offering a variety of lessons on life skills, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and financial empowerment. Throughout the lessons, the connection between gender equality and economic prosperity is emphasized. The project\u2019s overall objective is\nTo socially and economically empower young girls and boys (ages of 14 to 19) in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire by providing them with the social and financial skills necessary to make informed choices about their health, financial situation, and education.\n\n\nImpact assessment\n\nTo assess the impact of the Aflateen+ programme on adolescent girls and boys in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, this research will use a mixed-method approach, with a heavy quantitative component. The study will collect and evaluate quantitative data through a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) and qualitative data from e.g. Most Significant Change or Focus Group Discussions.\nThe main question of the research is: What is the effect of the Aflateen+ programme among participants of the Aflateen+ programme, relative to the representative control sample in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire?\nSince the project runs over three years, we aim to not only measure knowledge, awareness and attitudes of adolescent girls and boys, but also assess the impact of the programme on SDG outcome and impact indicators like school retention/attendance/drop-out, teenage pregnancy, gender based violence, and HIV-risk behaviour.\n\n\nCapacity assessment\n\nIn order to assess the effectiveness of the capacity building component of the project, the research will include two tools assessing the capacity of both trained partners/NGOs, as well as trained teachers/educators.\nAdding to that, as a follow up to the training of teachers, weekly push messages will be sent to the teachers or trainers via SMS or social media platforms. These messages may be questions or surveys on the progress of Aflateen+ activities. Additionally, micro content that reinforces learning, or guides teaching activities will be shared.\nThe evidence generated through this study will assist in regional advocacy and Aflatoun\u2019s engagement with regional bodies like SADC and the African Union, which will contribute to our efforts towards education system change.\n\nExperience requirements\nResearch institute/consultants should have:\n1. Experience conducting Random Control Trials;\n2. Extensive experience with leading a team of researchers and data enumerators incl. training of data enumerators on the use of evaluation tools;\n3.

The candidate should be available in February \u2013 April 2021 and December 2022 \u2013 February 2023.\n\nDeadline for submitting proposals: Monday 25 January 2021\n\n\nBackground\nAflatoun International is a non-profit organization, which offers social and financial education to children and young people worldwide, empowering them to make a positive change for a more equitable world. Aflatoun creates high-quality curricula, for different age groups, which are contextualized to local needs and specific circumstances. In 2019, Aflatoun reached 10.5 million children in 108 countries through over 345 partner organizations.\nAflatoun programs inspire children to discover their talents and put them to use, to stand up for their rights and those of their communities, to play games, and to solve problems. They learn how to save, how to budget, and how to set up social and financial enterprises that benefit themselves, their families, and their communities.\nAflatoun has been identified as a best in practice organisation by The Brookings Institution in the report 'Can We Leapfrog? The Potential of Education Innovations to Rapidly Accelerate Progress\u2019. The report presents a forward path in global education by examining the possibility of using innovations to \u2018leapfrog\u2019, rapidly accelerating educational progress to ensure that all young people develop the skills they need to thrive in a fast-changing world. Additionally, in 2019, HundrED Connect officially recognized Aflatoun as one of top 5 Spotlight Innovators for its work on financial education. HundrED Connect is an initiative that aims to improve education and inspire a movement by encouraging pedagogically sound and ambitious innovations to spread across the world. Aflatoun was also selected as an official Vanguard Member of the Million Lives Club, which celebrates innovators and social entrepreneurs who are reaching new horizons of impact and improving the lives of those living on less than $5 a day, and who have already scaled to serve at least 1,000,000 people.\n\n\nProject information\nWhile significant progress has been made towards universal primary school attendance, the reality is that a third (34%) of children of lower secondary school age (12-14 years) and more than half (58%) of 15 to 17-year-olds in sub-Saharan Africa are not in school. Hence, majority of those who should be acquiring the skills to prepare them for the job market, or move into further education, are not in the classroom, making it less likely that they will have a positive impact on their countries\u2019 development.\nImproving youth\u2019s future prospects for decent work helps break the intergenerational cycle of poverty and is beneficial for entire communities. To do so, it is crucial that adolescents understand money, resources and the markets that increasingly affect them, as they become consumers, workers and active citizens. This greatly improves their prospects for the future, as it prepares young people for a complex and turbulent job market.\n\nIn this context, Aflatoun will roll out its Aflateen+ programme in Zimbabwe through its partnership with implementing organization Junior Achievement Zimbabwe. Junior Achievement Zimbabwe is a not-for-profit organization aiming to prepare and inspire young people to value free enterprise, business, economics and entrepreneurship.\nAflateen+ is a comprehensive educational programme to transform the lives of adolescent girls and boys aged 14-19 through social and financial education, and entrepreneurship with a gender lens. The programme\u2019s biggest strength is its flexibility to adapt to the local needs of the girls and boys, while offering a variety of lessons on life skills, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and financial empowerment. Throughout the lessons, the connection between gender equality and economic prosperity is emphasized. The project\u2019s overall objective is\nTo socially and economically empower young girls and boys (ages of 14 to 19) in Zimbabwe by providing them with the social and financial skills necessary to make informed choices about their health, financial situation, and education.\n\n\nImpact assessment\n\nTo assess the impact of the Aflateen+ programme on adolescent girls and boys in Zimbabwe, this research will use a mixed-method approach, with a heavy quantitative component. The study will collect and evaluate quantitative data through a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) and qualitative data from e.g. Most Significant Change or Focus Group Discussions.\nThe main question of the research is: What is the effect of the Aflateen+ programme among participants of the Aflateen+ programme, relative to the representative control sample in Zimbabwe?\nSince the project runs over three years, we aim to not only measure knowledge, awareness and attitudes of adolescent girls and boys, but also assess the impact of the programme on SDG outcome and impact indicators like school retention/attendance/drop-out, teenage pregnancy, gender based violence, and HIV-risk behaviour.\n\n\nCapacity assessment\nIn order to assess the effectiveness of the capacity building component of the project, the research will include two tools assessing the capacity of both trained partners/NGOs, as well as trained teachers/educators.\nAdding to that, as a follow up to the training of teachers, weekly push messages will be sent to the teachers or trainers via SMS or social media platforms. These messages may be questions or surveys on the progress of Aflateen+ activities. Additionally, micro content that reinforces learning, or guides teaching activities will be shared.\nThe evidence generated through this study will assist in regional advocacy and Aflatoun\u2019s engagement with regional bodies like SADC and the African Union, which will contribute to our efforts towards education system change.\n\n\nExperience requirements\nResearch institute/consultants should have:\n1. Experience conducting Random Control Trials;\n2. Extensive experience with leading a team of researchers and data enumerators incl. training of data enumerators on the use of evaluation tools;\n3.

The candidate should be available in February \u2013 April 2021 and December 2022 \u2013 February 2023.\nDeadline for submitting proposals: Monday 25 January 2021\n\n\nBackground\n\nAflatoun International is a non-profit organization, which offers social and financial education to children and young people worldwide, empowering them to make a positive change for a more equitable world. Aflatoun creates high-quality curricula, for different age groups, which are contextualized to local needs and specific circumstances. In 2019, Aflatoun reached 10.5 million children in 108 countries through over 345 partner organizations.\nAflatoun programs inspire children to discover their talents and put them to use, to stand up for their rights and those of their communities, to play games, and to solve problems. They learn how to save, how to budget, and how to set up social and financial enterprises that benefit themselves, their families, and their communities.\nAflatoun has been identified as a best in practice organisation by The Brookings Institution in the report 'Can We Leapfrog? The Potential of Education Innovations to Rapidly Accelerate Progress\u2019. The report presents a forward path in global education by examining the possibility of using innovations to \u2018leapfrog\u2019, rapidly accelerating educational progress to ensure that all young people develop the skills they need to thrive in a fast-changing world. Additionally, in 2019, HundrED Connect officially recognized Aflatoun as one of top 5 Spotlight Innovators for its work on financial education. HundrED Connect is an initiative that aims to improve education and inspire a movement by encouraging pedagogically sound and ambitious innovations to spread across the world. Aflatoun was also selected as an official Vanguard Member of the Million Lives Club, which celebrates innovators and social entrepreneurs who are reaching new horizons of impact and improving the lives of those living on less than $5 a day, and who have already scaled to serve at least 1,000,000 people.\n\n\nProject information\n\nWhile significant progress has been made towards universal primary school attendance, the reality is that a third (34%) of children of lower secondary school age (12-14 years) and more than half (58%) of 15 to 17-year-olds in sub-Saharan Africa are not in school. Hence, majority of those who should be acquiring the skills to prepare them for the job market, or move into further education, are not in the classroom, making it less likely that they will have a positive impact on their countries\u2019 development.\nImproving youth\u2019s future prospects for decent work helps break the intergenerational cycle of poverty and is beneficial for entire communities. To do so, it is crucial that adolescents understand money, resources and the markets that increasingly affect them, as they become consumers, workers and active citizens. This greatly improves their prospects for the future, as it prepares young people for a complex and turbulent job market.\n\nthis context, Aflatoun will roll out its Aflateen+ programme in Mozambique through its partnership with implementing organization Wona Sanana (WS).\nWona Sanana (WS) is a Mozambique-based organization dedicated to Child Protection and Education through providing technical assistance to local actors focusing on youth and education, and through advocating for the involvement of government agencies to ensure inclusive education and child protection policies.\nAflateen+ is a comprehensive educational programme to transform the lives of adolescent girls and boys aged 14-19 through social and financial education, and entrepreneurship with a gender lens. The programme\u2019s biggest strength is its flexibility to adapt to the local needs of the girls and boys, while offering a variety of lessons on life skills, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and financial empowerment. Throughout the lessons, the connection between gender equality and economic prosperity is emphasized. The project\u2019s overall objective is\nTo socially and economically empower young girls and boys (ages of 14 to 19) in Mozambique by providing them with the social and financial skills necessary to make informed choices about their health, financial situation, and education.\n\n\nImpact assessment\n\nTo assess the impact of the Aflateen+ programme on adolescent girls and boys in Mozambique, this research will use a mixed-method approach, with a heavy quantitative component. The study will collect and evaluate quantitative data through a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) and qualitative data from e.g. Most Significant Change or Focus Group Discussions.\nThe main question of the research is: What is the effect of the Aflateen+ programme among participants of the Aflateen+ programme, relative to the representative control sample in Mozambique?\nSince the project runs over three years, we aim to not only measure knowledge, awareness and attitudes of adolescent girls and boys, but also assess the impact of the programme on SDG outcome and impact indicators like school retention/attendance/drop-out, teenage pregnancy, gender based violence, and HIV-risk behaviour.\n\n\nCapacity assessment\n\nIn order to assess the effectiveness of the capacity building component of the project, the research will include two tools assessing the capacity of both trained partners/NGOs, as well as trained teachers/educators.\nAdding to that, as a follow up to the training of teachers, weekly push messages will be sent to the teachers or trainers via SMS or social media platforms. These messages may be questions or surveys on the progress of Aflateen+ activities. Additionally, micro content that reinforces learning, or guides teaching activities will be shared.\nThe evidence generated through this study will assist in regional advocacy and Aflatoun\u2019s engagement with regional bodies like SADC and the African Union, which will contribute to our efforts towards education system change.\n\n\nExperience requirements\nResearch institute/consultants should have:\n1.

The candidate should be available in February \u2013April 2021 and December 2022 \u2013 February 2023.\nDeadline for submitting proposals: Monday 25 January 2021\n\n\nBackground\n\nAflatoun International is a non-profit organization, which offers social and financial education to children and young people worldwide, empowering them to make a positive change for a more equitable world. Aflatoun creates high-quality curricula, for different age groups, which are contextualized to local needs and specific circumstances. In 2019, Aflatoun reached 10.5 million children in 108 countries through over 345 partner organizations.\nAflatoun programs inspire children to discover their talents and put them to use, to stand up for their rights and those of their communities, to play games, and to solve problems. They learn how to save, how to budget, and how to set up social and financial enterprises that benefit themselves, their families, and their communities.\nAflatoun has been identified as a best in practice organisation by The Brookings Institution in the report 'Can We Leapfrog? The Potential of Education Innovations to Rapidly Accelerate Progress\u2019. The report presents a forward path in global education by examining the possibility of using innovations to \u2018leapfrog\u2019, rapidly accelerating educational progress to ensure that all young people develop the skills they need to thrive in a fast-changing world. Additionally, in 2019, HundrED Connect officially recognized Aflatoun as one of top 5 Spotlight Innovators for its work on financial education. HundrED Connect is an initiative that aims to improve education and inspire a movement by encouraging pedagogically sound and ambitious innovations to spread across the world. Aflatoun was also selected as an official Vanguard Member of the Million Lives Club, which celebrates innovators and social entrepreneurs who are reaching new horizons of impact and improving the lives of those living on less than $5 a day, and who have already scaled to serve at least 1,000,000 people.\n\n\nProject information\nWhile significant progress has been made towards universal primary school attendance, the reality is that a third (34%) of children of lower secondary school age (12-14 years) and more than half (58%) of 15 to 17-year-olds in sub-Saharan Africa are not in school. Hence, majority of those who should be acquiring the skills to prepare them for the job market, or move into further education, are not in the classroom, making it less likely that they will have a positive impact on their countries\u2019 development.\nImproving youth\u2019s future prospects for decent work helps break the intergenerational cycle of poverty and is beneficial for entire communities. To do so, it is crucial that adolescents understand money, resources and the markets that increasingly affect them, as they become consumers, workers and active citizens. This greatly improves their prospects for the future, as it prepares young people for a complex and turbulent job market.\n\nIn this light, Aflatoun will roll out its Aflateen+ programme in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire through its partnership with implementing organization Inades Formation.\nInades Formation is a Pan-African, non-profit organisation currently operating from field offices across 10 African countries. Their aim is to promote social and economic development of rural populations through stimulating and supporting development alternatives within rural communities. The organization conducts citizen-based advocacy work aimed at contributing towards the development of shared values for living together, rules of governance and policies for the common good.\nAflateen+ is a comprehensive educational programme to transform the lives of adolescent girls and boys aged 14-19 through social and financial education, and entrepreneurship with a gender lens. The programme\u2019s biggest strength is its flexibility to adapt to the local needs of the girls and boys, while offering a variety of lessons on life skills, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and financial empowerment. Throughout the lessons, the connection between gender equality and economic prosperity is emphasized. The project\u2019s overall objective is\nTo socially and economically empower young girls and boys (ages of 14 to 19) in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire by providing them with the social and financial skills necessary to make informed choices about their health, financial situation, and education.\n\n\nImpact assessment\n\nTo assess the impact of the Aflateen+ programme on adolescent girls and boys in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, this research will use a mixed-method approach, with a heavy quantitative component. The study will collect and evaluate quantitative data through a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) and qualitative data from e.g. Most Significant Change or Focus Group Discussions.\nThe main question of the research is: What is the effect of the Aflateen+ programme among participants of the Aflateen+ programme, relative to the representative control sample in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire?\nSince the project runs over three years, we aim to not only measure knowledge, awareness and attitudes of adolescent girls and boys, but also assess the impact of the programme on SDG outcome and impact indicators like school retention/attendance/drop-out, teenage pregnancy, gender based violence, and HIV-risk behaviour.\n\n\nCapacity assessment\n\nIn order to assess the effectiveness of the capacity building component of the project, the research will include two tools assessing the capacity of both trained partners/NGOs, as well as trained teachers/educators.\nAdding to that, as a follow up to the training of teachers, weekly push messages will be sent to the teachers or trainers via SMS or social media platforms. These messages may be questions or surveys on the progress of Aflateen+ activities. Additionally, micro content that reinforces learning, or guides teaching activities will be shared.\nThe evidence generated through this study will assist in regional advocacy and Aflatoun\u2019s engagement with regional bodies like SADC and the African Union, which will contribute to our efforts towards education system change.\n\nExperience requirements\nResearch institute/consultants should have:\n1.

The candidate should be available in February \u2013 April 2021 and December 2022 \u2013 February 2023.\n\nDeadline for submitting proposals: Monday 25 January 2021\n\n\nBackground\nAflatoun International is a non-profit organization, which offers social and financial education to children and young people worldwide, empowering them to make a positive change for a more equitable world. Aflatoun creates high-quality curricula, for different age groups, which are contextualized to local needs and specific circumstances. In 2019, Aflatoun reached 10.5 million children in 108 countries through over 345 partner organizations.\nAflatoun programs inspire children to discover their talents and put them to use, to stand up for their rights and those of their communities, to play games, and to solve problems. They learn how to save, how to budget, and how to set up social and financial enterprises that benefit themselves, their families, and their communities.\nAflatoun has been identified as a best in practice organisation by The Brookings Institution in the report 'Can We Leapfrog? The Potential of Education Innovations to Rapidly Accelerate Progress\u2019. The report presents a forward path in global education by examining the possibility of using innovations to \u2018leapfrog\u2019, rapidly accelerating educational progress to ensure that all young people develop the skills they need to thrive in a fast-changing world. Additionally, in 2019, HundrED Connect officially recognized Aflatoun as one of top 5 Spotlight Innovators for its work on financial education. HundrED Connect is an initiative that aims to improve education and inspire a movement by encouraging pedagogically sound and ambitious innovations to spread across the world. Aflatoun was also selected as an official Vanguard Member of the Million Lives Club, which celebrates innovators and social entrepreneurs who are reaching new horizons of impact and improving the lives of those living on less than $5 a day, and who have already scaled to serve at least 1,000,000 people.\n\n\nProject information\nWhile significant progress has been made towards universal primary school attendance, the reality is that a third (34%) of children of lower secondary school age (12-14 years) and more than half (58%) of 15 to 17-year-olds in sub-Saharan Africa are not in school. Hence, majority of those who should be acquiring the skills to prepare them for the job market, or move into further education, are not in the classroom, making it less likely that they will have a positive impact on their countries\u2019 development.\nImproving youth\u2019s future prospects for decent work helps break the intergenerational cycle of poverty and is beneficial for entire communities. To do so, it is crucial that adolescents understand money, resources and the markets that increasingly affect them, as they become consumers, workers and active citizens. This greatly improves their prospects for the future, as it prepares young people for a complex and turbulent job market.\n\nIn this context, Aflatoun will roll out its Aflateen+ programme in Zimbabwe through its partnership with implementing organization Junior Achievement Zimbabwe. Junior Achievement Zimbabwe is a not-for-profit organization aiming to prepare and inspire young people to value free enterprise, business, economics and entrepreneurship.\nAflateen+ is a comprehensive educational programme to transform the lives of adolescent girls and boys aged 14-19 through social and financial education, and entrepreneurship with a gender lens. The programme\u2019s biggest strength is its flexibility to adapt to the local needs of the girls and boys, while offering a variety of lessons on life skills, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and financial empowerment. Throughout the lessons, the connection between gender equality and economic prosperity is emphasized. The project\u2019s overall objective is\nTo socially and economically empower young girls and boys (ages of 14 to 19) in Zimbabwe by providing them with the social and financial skills necessary to make informed choices about their health, financial situation, and education.\n\n\nImpact assessment\n\nTo assess the impact of the Aflateen+ programme on adolescent girls and boys in Zimbabwe, this research will use a mixed-method approach, with a heavy quantitative component. The study will collect and evaluate quantitative data through a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) and qualitative data from e.g. Most Significant Change or Focus Group Discussions.\nThe main question of the research is: What is the effect of the Aflateen+ programme among participants of the Aflateen+ programme, relative to the representative control sample in Zimbabwe?\nSince the project runs over three years, we aim to not only measure knowledge, awareness and attitudes of adolescent girls and boys, but also assess the impact of the programme on SDG outcome and impact indicators like school retention/attendance/drop-out, teenage pregnancy, gender based violence, and HIV-risk behaviour.\n\n\nCapacity assessment\nIn order to assess the effectiveness of the capacity building component of the project, the research will include two tools assessing the capacity of both trained partners/NGOs, as well as trained teachers/educators.\nAdding to that, as a follow up to the training of teachers, weekly push messages will be sent to the teachers or trainers via SMS or social media platforms. These messages may be questions or surveys on the progress of Aflateen+ activities. Additionally, micro content that reinforces learning, or guides teaching activities will be shared.\nThe evidence generated through this study will assist in regional advocacy and Aflatoun\u2019s engagement with regional bodies like SADC and the African Union, which will contribute to our efforts towards education system change.\n\n\nExperience requirements\nResearch institute/consultants should have:\n1. Experience conducting Random Control Trials;\n2. Extensive experience with leading a team of researchers and data enumerators incl. training of data enumerators on the use of evaluation tools;\n3.

They learn how to save, how to budget, and how to set up social and financial enterprises that benefit themselves, their families, and their communities.\nAflatoun has been identified as a best in practice organisation by The Brookings Institution in the report 'Can We Leapfrog? The Potential of Education Innovations to Rapidly Accelerate Progress\u2019. The report presents a forward path in global education by examining the possibility of using innovations to \u2018leapfrog\u2019, rapidly accelerating educational progress to ensure that all young people develop the skills they need to thrive in a fast-changing world. Additionally, in 2019, HundrED Connect officially recognized Aflatoun as one of top 5 Spotlight Innovators for its work on financial education. HundrED Connect is an initiative that aims to improve education and inspire a movement by encouraging pedagogically sound and ambitious innovations to spread across the world. Aflatoun was also selected as an official Vanguard Member of the Million Lives Club, which celebrates innovators and social entrepreneurs who are reaching new horizons of impact and improving the lives of those living on less than $5 a day, and who have already scaled to serve at least 1,000,000 people.\n\n\nProject information\n\nWhile significant progress has been made towards universal primary school attendance, the reality is that a third (34%) of children of lower secondary school age (12-14 years) and more than half (58%) of 15 to 17-year-olds in sub-Saharan Africa are not in school. Hence, majority of those who should be acquiring the skills to prepare them for the job market, or move into further education, are not in the classroom, making it less likely that they will have a positive impact on their countries\u2019 development.\nImproving youth\u2019s future prospects for decent work helps break the intergenerational cycle of poverty and is beneficial for entire communities. To do so, it is crucial that adolescents understand money, resources and the markets that increasingly affect them, as they become consumers, workers and active citizens. This greatly improves their prospects for the future, as it prepares young people for a complex and turbulent job market.\n\nthis context, Aflatoun will roll out its Aflateen+ programme in Mozambique through its partnership with implementing organization Wona Sanana (WS).\nWona Sanana (WS) is a Mozambique-based organization dedicated to Child Protection and Education through providing technical assistance to local actors focusing on youth and education, and through advocating for the involvement of government agencies to ensure inclusive education and child protection policies.\nAflateen+ is a comprehensive educational programme to transform the lives of adolescent girls and boys aged 14-19 through social and financial education, and entrepreneurship with a gender lens. The programme\u2019s biggest strength is its flexibility to adapt to the local needs of the girls and boys, while offering a variety of lessons on life skills, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and financial empowerment. Throughout the lessons, the connection between gender equality and economic prosperity is emphasized. The project\u2019s overall objective is\nTo socially and economically empower young girls and boys (ages of 14 to 19) in Mozambique by providing them with the social and financial skills necessary to make informed choices about their health, financial situation, and education.\n\n\nImpact assessment\n\nTo assess the impact of the Aflateen+ programme on adolescent girls and boys in Mozambique, this research will use a mixed-method approach, with a heavy quantitative component. The study will collect and evaluate quantitative data through a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) and qualitative data from e.g. Most Significant Change or Focus Group Discussions.\nThe main question of the research is: What is the effect of the Aflateen+ programme among participants of the Aflateen+ programme, relative to the representative control sample in Mozambique?\nSince the project runs over three years, we aim to not only measure knowledge, awareness and attitudes of adolescent girls and boys, but also assess the impact of the programme on SDG outcome and impact indicators like school retention/attendance/drop-out, teenage pregnancy, gender based violence, and HIV-risk behaviour.\n\n\nCapacity assessment\n\nIn order to assess the effectiveness of the capacity building component of the project, the research will include two tools assessing the capacity of both trained partners/NGOs, as well as trained teachers/educators.\nAdding to that, as a follow up to the training of teachers, weekly push messages will be sent to the teachers or trainers via SMS or social media platforms. These messages may be questions or surveys on the progress of Aflateen+ activities. Additionally, micro content that reinforces learning, or guides teaching activities will be shared.\nThe evidence generated through this study will assist in regional advocacy and Aflatoun\u2019s engagement with regional bodies like SADC and the African Union, which will contribute to our efforts towards education system change.\n\n\nExperience requirements\nResearch institute/consultants should have:\n1.

The candidate should be available in February \u2013April 2021 and December 2022 \u2013 February 2023.\nDeadline for submitting proposals: Monday 25 January 2021\n\n\nBackground\n\nAflatoun International is a non-profit organization, which offers social and financial education to children and young people worldwide, empowering them to make a positive change for a more equitable world. Aflatoun creates high-quality curricula, for different age groups, which are contextualized to local needs and specific circumstances. In 2019, Aflatoun reached 10.5 million children in 108 countries through over 345 partner organizations.\nAflatoun programs inspire children to discover their talents and put them to use, to stand up for their rights and those of their communities, to play games, and to solve problems. They learn how to save, how to budget, and how to set up social and financial enterprises that benefit themselves, their families, and their communities.\nAflatoun has been identified as a best in practice organisation by The Brookings Institution in the report 'Can We Leapfrog? The Potential of Education Innovations to Rapidly Accelerate Progress\u2019. The report presents a forward path in global education by examining the possibility of using innovations to \u2018leapfrog\u2019, rapidly accelerating educational progress to ensure that all young people develop the skills they need to thrive in a fast-changing world. Additionally, in 2019, HundrED Connect officially recognized Aflatoun as one of top 5 Spotlight Innovators for its work on financial education. HundrED Connect is an initiative that aims to improve education and inspire a movement by encouraging pedagogically sound and ambitious innovations to spread across the world. Aflatoun was also selected as an official Vanguard Member of the Million Lives Club, which celebrates innovators and social entrepreneurs who are reaching new horizons of impact and improving the lives of those living on less than $5 a day, and who have already scaled to serve at least 1,000,000 people.\n\n\nProject information\nWhile significant progress has been made towards universal primary school attendance, the reality is that a third (34%) of children of lower secondary school age (12-14 years) and more than half (58%) of 15 to 17-year-olds in sub-Saharan Africa are not in school. Hence, majority of those who should be acquiring the skills to prepare them for the job market, or move into further education, are not in the classroom, making it less likely that they will have a positive impact on their countries\u2019 development.\nImproving youth\u2019s future prospects for decent work helps break the intergenerational cycle of poverty and is beneficial for entire communities. To do so, it is crucial that adolescents understand money, resources and the markets that increasingly affect them, as they become consumers, workers and active citizens. This greatly improves their prospects for the future, as it prepares young people for a complex and turbulent job market.\n\nIn this light, Aflatoun will roll out its Aflateen+ programme in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire through its partnership with implementing organization Inades Formation.\nInades Formation is a Pan-African, non-profit organisation currently operating from field offices across 10 African countries. Their aim is to promote social and economic development of rural populations through stimulating and supporting development alternatives within rural communities. The organization conducts citizen-based advocacy work aimed at contributing towards the development of shared values for living together, rules of governance and policies for the common good.\nAflateen+ is a comprehensive educational programme to transform the lives of adolescent girls and boys aged 14-19 through social and financial education, and entrepreneurship with a gender lens. The programme\u2019s biggest strength is its flexibility to adapt to the local needs of the girls and boys, while offering a variety of lessons on life skills, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and financial empowerment. Throughout the lessons, the connection between gender equality and economic prosperity is emphasized. The project\u2019s overall objective is\nTo socially and economically empower young girls and boys (ages of 14 to 19) in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire by providing them with the social and financial skills necessary to make informed choices about their health, financial situation, and education.\n\n\nImpact assessment\n\nTo assess the impact of the Aflateen+ programme on adolescent girls and boys in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, this research will use a mixed-method approach, with a heavy quantitative component. The study will collect and evaluate quantitative data through a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) and qualitative data from e.g. Most Significant Change or Focus Group Discussions.\nThe main question of the research is: What is the effect of the Aflateen+ programme among participants of the Aflateen+ programme, relative to the representative control sample in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire?\nSince the project runs over three years, we aim to not only measure knowledge, awareness and attitudes of adolescent girls and boys, but also assess the impact of the programme on SDG outcome and impact indicators like school retention/attendance/drop-out, teenage pregnancy, gender based violence, and HIV-risk behaviour.\n\n\nCapacity assessment\n\nIn order to assess the effectiveness of the capacity building component of the project, the research will include two tools assessing the capacity of both trained partners/NGOs, as well as trained teachers/educators.\nAdding to that, as a follow up to the training of teachers, weekly push messages will be sent to the teachers or trainers via SMS or social media platforms. These messages may be questions or surveys on the progress of Aflateen+ activities. Additionally, micro content that reinforces learning, or guides teaching activities will be shared.\nThe evidence generated through this study will assist in regional advocacy and Aflatoun\u2019s engagement with regional bodies like SADC and the African Union, which will contribute to our efforts towards education system change.\n\nExperience requirements\nResearch institute/consultants should have:\n1. Experience conducting Random Control Trials;\n2. Extensive experience with leading a team of researchers and data enumerators incl. training of data enumerators on the use of evaluation tools;\n3.

The candidate should be available in February \u2013 April 2021 and December 2022 \u2013 February 2023.\n\nDeadline for submitting proposals: Monday 25 January 2021\n\n\nBackground\nAflatoun International is a non-profit organization, which offers social and financial education to children and young people worldwide, empowering them to make a positive change for a more equitable world. Aflatoun creates high-quality curricula, for different age groups, which are contextualized to local needs and specific circumstances. In 2019, Aflatoun reached 10.5 million children in 108 countries through over 345 partner organizations.\nAflatoun programs inspire children to discover their talents and put them to use, to stand up for their rights and those of their communities, to play games, and to solve problems. They learn how to save, how to budget, and how to set up social and financial enterprises that benefit themselves, their families, and their communities.\nAflatoun has been identified as a best in practice organisation by The Brookings Institution in the report 'Can We Leapfrog? The Potential of Education Innovations to Rapidly Accelerate Progress\u2019. The report presents a forward path in global education by examining the possibility of using innovations to \u2018leapfrog\u2019, rapidly accelerating educational progress to ensure that all young people develop the skills they need to thrive in a fast-changing world. Additionally, in 2019, HundrED Connect officially recognized Aflatoun as one of top 5 Spotlight Innovators for its work on financial education. HundrED Connect is an initiative that aims to improve education and inspire a movement by encouraging pedagogically sound and ambitious innovations to spread across the world. Aflatoun was also selected as an official Vanguard Member of the Million Lives Club, which celebrates innovators and social entrepreneurs who are reaching new horizons of impact and improving the lives of those living on less than $5 a day, and who have already scaled to serve at least 1,000,000 people.\n\n\nProject information\nWhile significant progress has been made towards universal primary school attendance, the reality is that a third (34%) of children of lower secondary school age (12-14 years) and more than half (58%) of 15 to 17-year-olds in sub-Saharan Africa are not in school. Hence, majority of those who should be acquiring the skills to prepare them for the job market, or move into further education, are not in the classroom, making it less likely that they will have a positive impact on their countries\u2019 development.\nImproving youth\u2019s future prospects for decent work helps break the intergenerational cycle of poverty and is beneficial for entire communities. To do so, it is crucial that adolescents understand money, resources and the markets that increasingly affect them, as they become consumers, workers and active citizens. This greatly improves their prospects for the future, as it prepares young people for a complex and turbulent job market.\n\nIn this context, Aflatoun will roll out its Aflateen+ programme in Zimbabwe through its partnership with implementing organization Junior Achievement Zimbabwe. Junior Achievement Zimbabwe is a not-for-profit organization aiming to prepare and inspire young people to value free enterprise, business, economics and entrepreneurship.\nAflateen+ is a comprehensive educational programme to transform the lives of adolescent girls and boys aged 14-19 through social and financial education, and entrepreneurship with a gender lens. The programme\u2019s biggest strength is its flexibility to adapt to the local needs of the girls and boys, while offering a variety of lessons on life skills, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and financial empowerment. Throughout the lessons, the connection between gender equality and economic prosperity is emphasized. The project\u2019s overall objective is\nTo socially and economically empower young girls and boys (ages of 14 to 19) in Zimbabwe by providing them with the social and financial skills necessary to make informed choices about their health, financial situation, and education.\n\n\nImpact assessment\n\nTo assess the impact of the Aflateen+ programme on adolescent girls and boys in Zimbabwe, this research will use a mixed-method approach, with a heavy quantitative component. The study will collect and evaluate quantitative data through a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) and qualitative data from e.g. Most Significant Change or Focus Group Discussions.\nThe main question of the research is: What is the effect of the Aflateen+ programme among participants of the Aflateen+ programme, relative to the representative control sample in Zimbabwe?\nSince the project runs over three years, we aim to not only measure knowledge, awareness and attitudes of adolescent girls and boys, but also assess the impact of the programme on SDG outcome and impact indicators like school retention/attendance/drop-out, teenage pregnancy, gender based violence, and HIV-risk behaviour.\n\n\nCapacity assessment\nIn order to assess the effectiveness of the capacity building component of the project, the research will include two tools assessing the capacity of both trained partners/NGOs, as well as trained teachers/educators.\nAdding to that, as a follow up to the training of teachers, weekly push messages will be sent to the teachers or trainers via SMS or social media platforms. These messages may be questions or surveys on the progress of Aflateen+ activities. Additionally, micro content that reinforces learning, or guides teaching activities will be shared.\nThe evidence generated through this study will assist in regional advocacy and Aflatoun\u2019s engagement with regional bodies like SADC and the African Union, which will contribute to our efforts towards education system change.\n\n\nExperience requirements\nResearch institute/consultants should have:\n1.

The candidate should be available in February \u2013 April 2021 and December 2022 \u2013 February 2023.\nDeadline for submitting proposals: Monday 25 January 2021\n\n\nBackground\n\nAflatoun International is a non-profit organization, which offers social and financial education to children and young people worldwide, empowering them to make a positive change for a more equitable world. Aflatoun creates high-quality curricula, for different age groups, which are contextualized to local needs and specific circumstances. In 2019, Aflatoun reached 10.5 million children in 108 countries through over 345 partner organizations.\nAflatoun programs inspire children to discover their talents and put them to use, to stand up for their rights and those of their communities, to play games, and to solve problems. They learn how to save, how to budget, and how to set up social and financial enterprises that benefit themselves, their families, and their communities.\nAflatoun has been identified as a best in practice organisation by The Brookings Institution in the report 'Can We Leapfrog? The Potential of Education Innovations to Rapidly Accelerate Progress\u2019. The report presents a forward path in global education by examining the possibility of using innovations to \u2018leapfrog\u2019, rapidly accelerating educational progress to ensure that all young people develop the skills they need to thrive in a fast-changing world. Additionally, in 2019, HundrED Connect officially recognized Aflatoun as one of top 5 Spotlight Innovators for its work on financial education. HundrED Connect is an initiative that aims to improve education and inspire a movement by encouraging pedagogically sound and ambitious innovations to spread across the world. Aflatoun was also selected as an official Vanguard Member of the Million Lives Club, which celebrates innovators and social entrepreneurs who are reaching new horizons of impact and improving the lives of those living on less than $5 a day, and who have already scaled to serve at least 1,000,000 people.\n\n\nProject information\n\nWhile significant progress has been made towards universal primary school attendance, the reality is that a third (34%) of children of lower secondary school age (12-14 years) and more than half (58%) of 15 to 17-year-olds in sub-Saharan Africa are not in school. Hence, majority of those who should be acquiring the skills to prepare them for the job market, or move into further education, are not in the classroom, making it less likely that they will have a positive impact on their countries\u2019 development.\nImproving youth\u2019s future prospects for decent work helps break the intergenerational cycle of poverty and is beneficial for entire communities. To do so, it is crucial that adolescents understand money, resources and the markets that increasingly affect them, as they become consumers, workers and active citizens. This greatly improves their prospects for the future, as it prepares young people for a complex and turbulent job market.\n\nthis context, Aflatoun will roll out its Aflateen+ programme in Mozambique through its partnership with implementing organization Wona Sanana (WS).\nWona Sanana (WS) is a Mozambique-based organization dedicated to Child Protection and Education through providing technical assistance to local actors focusing on youth and education, and through advocating for the involvement of government agencies to ensure inclusive education and child protection policies.\nAflateen+ is a comprehensive educational programme to transform the lives of adolescent girls and boys aged 14-19 through social and financial education, and entrepreneurship with a gender lens. The programme\u2019s biggest strength is its flexibility to adapt to the local needs of the girls and boys, while offering a variety of lessons on life skills, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and financial empowerment. Throughout the lessons, the connection between gender equality and economic prosperity is emphasized. The project\u2019s overall objective is\nTo socially and economically empower young girls and boys (ages of 14 to 19) in Mozambique by providing them with the social and financial skills necessary to make informed choices about their health, financial situation, and education.\n\n\nImpact assessment\n\nTo assess the impact of the Aflateen+ programme on adolescent girls and boys in Mozambique, this research will use a mixed-method approach, with a heavy quantitative component. The study will collect and evaluate quantitative data through a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) and qualitative data from e.g. Most Significant Change or Focus Group Discussions.\nThe main question of the research is: What is the effect of the Aflateen+ programme among participants of the Aflateen+ programme, relative to the representative control sample in Mozambique?\nSince the project runs over three years, we aim to not only measure knowledge, awareness and attitudes of adolescent girls and boys, but also assess the impact of the programme on SDG outcome and impact indicators like school retention/attendance/drop-out, teenage pregnancy, gender based violence, and HIV-risk behaviour.\n\n\nCapacity assessment\n\nIn order to assess the effectiveness of the capacity building component of the project, the research will include two tools assessing the capacity of both trained partners/NGOs, as well as trained teachers/educators.\nAdding to that, as a follow up to the training of teachers, weekly push messages will be sent to the teachers or trainers via SMS or social media platforms. These messages may be questions or surveys on the progress of Aflateen+ activities. Additionally, micro content that reinforces learning, or guides teaching activities will be shared.\nThe evidence generated through this study will assist in regional advocacy and Aflatoun\u2019s engagement with regional bodies like SADC and the African Union, which will contribute to our efforts towards education system change.\n\n\nExperience requirements\nResearch institute/consultants should have:\n1.

The report presents a forward path in global education by examining the possibility of using innovations to \u2018leapfrog\u2019, rapidly accelerating educational progress to ensure that all young people develop the skills they need to thrive in a fast-changing world. Additionally, in 2019, HundrED Connect officially recognized Aflatoun as one of top 5 Spotlight Innovators for its work on financial education. HundrED Connect is an initiative that aims to improve education and inspire a movement by encouraging pedagogically sound and ambitious innovations to spread across the world. Aflatoun was also selected as an official Vanguard Member of the Million Lives Club, which celebrates innovators and social entrepreneurs who are reaching new horizons of impact and improving the lives of those living on less than $5 a day, and who have already scaled to serve at least 1,000,000 people.\n\n\nProject information\nWhile significant progress has been made towards universal primary school attendance, the reality is that a third (34%) of children of lower secondary school age (12-14 years) and more than half (58%) of 15 to 17-year-olds in sub-Saharan Africa are not in school. Hence, majority of those who should be acquiring the skills to prepare them for the job market, or move into further education, are not in the classroom, making it less likely that they will have a positive impact on their countries\u2019 development.\nImproving youth\u2019s future prospects for decent work helps break the intergenerational cycle of poverty and is beneficial for entire communities. To do so, it is crucial that adolescents understand money, resources and the markets that increasingly affect them, as they become consumers, workers and active citizens. This greatly improves their prospects for the future, as it prepares young people for a complex and turbulent job market.\n\nIn this light, Aflatoun will roll out its Aflateen+ programme in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire through its partnership with implementing organization Inades Formation.\nInades Formation is a Pan-African, non-profit organisation currently operating from field offices across 10 African countries. Their aim is to promote social and economic development of rural populations through stimulating and supporting development alternatives within rural communities. The organization conducts citizen-based advocacy work aimed at contributing towards the development of shared values for living together, rules of governance and policies for the common good.\nAflateen+ is a comprehensive educational programme to transform the lives of adolescent girls and boys aged 14-19 through social and financial education, and entrepreneurship with a gender lens. The programme\u2019s biggest strength is its flexibility to adapt to the local needs of the girls and boys, while offering a variety of lessons on life skills, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and financial empowerment. Throughout the lessons, the connection between gender equality and economic prosperity is emphasized. The project\u2019s overall objective is\nTo socially and economically empower young girls and boys (ages of 14 to 19) in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire by providing them with the social and financial skills necessary to make informed choices about their health, financial situation, and education.\n\n\nImpact assessment\n\nTo assess the impact of the Aflateen+ programme on adolescent girls and boys in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, this research will use a mixed-method approach, with a heavy quantitative component. The study will collect and evaluate quantitative data through a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) and qualitative data from e.g. Most Significant Change or Focus Group Discussions.\nThe main question of the research is: What is the effect of the Aflateen+ programme among participants of the Aflateen+ programme, relative to the representative control sample in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire?\nSince the project runs over three years, we aim to not only measure knowledge, awareness and attitudes of adolescent girls and boys, but also assess the impact of the programme on SDG outcome and impact indicators like school retention/attendance/drop-out, teenage pregnancy, gender based violence, and HIV-risk behaviour.\n\n\nCapacity assessment\n\nIn order to assess the effectiveness of the capacity building component of the project, the research will include two tools assessing the capacity of both trained partners/NGOs, as well as trained teachers/educators.\nAdding to that, as a follow up to the training of teachers, weekly push messages will be sent to the teachers or trainers via SMS or social media platforms. These messages may be questions or surveys on the progress of Aflateen+ activities. Additionally, micro content that reinforces learning, or guides teaching activities will be shared.\nThe evidence generated through this study will assist in regional advocacy and Aflatoun\u2019s engagement with regional bodies like SADC and the African Union, which will contribute to our efforts towards education system change.\n\nExperience requirements\nResearch institute/consultants should have:\n1.
