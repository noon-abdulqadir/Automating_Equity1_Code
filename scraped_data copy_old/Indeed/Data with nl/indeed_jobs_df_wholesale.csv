Red Bull Nederland blijft maar groeien! De gezamenlijke doelstelling van het sales team is om deze groei verder te versnellen en te blijven winnen vs de concurrentie. Ben jij op zoek naar vleugels en wil je meebouwen aan ons succes? Binnen het Out-of-Home team is een uitdagende rol vrijgekomen, namelijk de rol van Accountmanager Wholesale.
Voor de invulling van deze rol zijn we op zoek naar een energiek en ambitieus commercieel persoon met minimaal 3 jaar werkervaring binnen een FMCG omgeving en een sterke affiniteit met sales. De Accountmanager is in de basis verantwoordelijk voor de ontwikkeling en implementatie van de verkoopstrategie van verschillende groothandels binnen het Out-of-Home kanaal. Denk hierbij aan (dranken)groothandels als Bidfood, Makro, Inbev en Bavaria. Je bent daarbij onder meer verantwoordelijk voor het onderhouden en versterken van klantrelaties, het bouwen van nieuwe distributie, en interne afstemming binnen de organisatie.
NATIONAAL
Het Out-of-Home landschap verandert enorm. De manier waarop we uitgaan, hoeveel we buiten de deur zijn en een vitalere levensstijl nastreven heeft er toe geleid dat we veel vaker onderweg zijn en meer buitenhuis consumeren. Op termijn zal de relevantie van het Out-of-Home kanaal alleen maar verder toenemen en hiermee ook het belang voor Red Bull. Als Accountmanager Wholesale heb jij als belangrijke taak om middels strategische samenwerkingen met de groothandels nieuwe lange termijn distributie te creëren in voor Red Bull belangrijke Out-of-Home kanalen als de Horeca (restaurant/bar/cafe), At Work en Sport. Zowel bij de traditionele groothandels (bijv. Bidfood en Makro) als ook bij de drankengroothandels (bijv. Inbev, Bavaria) ligt er een uitstekende basis, maar is er tegelijkertijd ook nog een enorme potentie om te groeien. Vanuit het analyseren van data en inzichten breng je de markt in kaart, waarmee je aan de slag gaat met de groothandels en samen een actieplan ontwikkelt. In afstemming met de Channel Manager houd je zowel de volume en distributie doelstellingen als ook de financiële richtlijnen scherp in de gaten.
STRATEGIE & ANALYSE
Als Accountmanager Wholesale lever je input voor het Business Plan voor het daaropvolgende jaar en leid je de uitvoering van de Red Bull Wholesale strategie, in lijn met de algemene nationale strategie. Specifiek definieer je een duurzaam groeimodel wat moet bijdragen aan structurele groei van distributie van het Red Bull portfolio binnen het Out-of-Home kanaal in Nederland. Middels het analyseren van data en inzichten breng je de markt in kaart, ontwikkel je een actieplan en evalueer je de resultaten.
TRACKING & PLANNING
Je volgt continue jouw doelstellingen op distributie, volume en winstgevendheid en je past je plannen aan wanneer nodig. Je bespreekt met je klant de jaardoelstellingen en draagt ook zorg voor de jaarlijkse/maandelijkse forecast voor elke groothandel als het gaat om investeringen en verkoop. Je stemt alle condities, promoties en activaties af met alle benodigde stakeholders om behoud van winstgevendheid te maximaliseren.
RELATIEMANAGEMENT & ONDERHANDELEN
Binnen deze rol behoud en versterk je de relatie met onze klanten. Je schakelt met de diverse disciplines aan klantzijde, waardoor een intensieve samenwerking ontstaat. Jij bent verantwoordelijk voor het sluiten van de (jaar)deals bij jouw klanten met een maximale omzet & distributie resultaat tot gevolg, zowel voor de groothandels als voor Red Bull.
