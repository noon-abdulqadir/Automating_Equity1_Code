  abstract = {This article studies gender differences in media portrayals of political leadership, starting with the expectation that male politicians are evaluated more often on traits belonging to the male leader stereotype, and that female politicians have no such advantage. These gender differences are expected to be especially pronounced during non-campaign periods. To test these expectations, a large-scale automated content analysis of all Dutch national newspapers from September 2006 to September 2012 was conducted. The results show that male politicians received more media coverage on leadership traits in general, although the male and female leader stereotypes explain most of the variation in gender bias between leadership traits. These gender effects are found during seldom-studied routine periods but not during campaigns. As leadership trait coverage has electoral consequences, this gender-differentiated coverage likely contributes to the under-representation of women in politics.},

  abstract = {Business-oriented social networks like LinkedIn or XING support people in discovering career opportunities. In this talk, we will focus on the problem of recommending job offers to Millions of XING users. We will discuss challenges of building a job recommendation system that has to satisfy the demands of both job seekers who have certain wishes concerning their next career step and recruiters who aim to hire the most appropriate candidate for a job. Based on insights gained from a large-scale analysis of usage data and profile data such as curriculum vitae, we will study features of the recommendation algorithms that aim to solve the problem. Job advertisements typically describe the job role that the candidate will need to fill, required skills, the expected educational background that candidates should have and the company and environment in which candidates will be working. Users of professional social networks curate their profile and curriculum vitae in which they describe their skills, interests and previous career steps. Recommending jobs to users is however a non-trivial task for which pure content-based features that would just match the aforementioned properties are not sufficient. For example, we often observe that there is a gap between what people specify in their profiles and what they are actually interested in. Moreover, profile and CV typically describe the past and current situation of a user but do not reflect enough the actual demands that users have with respect to their next career step. Therefore, it is crucial to also analyze the behavior of the users and exploit interaction data such as search queries, clicks on jobs, bookmarks, clicks that similar users performed, etc. Our job recommendation system exploits various features in order to estimate whether a job posting is relevant for a user or not. Some of these features rather reflect social aspects (e.g. does the user have contacts that are living in the city in which the job is offered?) while others capture to what extent the user fulfills the requirements of the role that is described in the job advertisement (e.g. similarity of user's skills and required skills). To better understand appropriate next career steps, we mine the CVs of the users and learn association rules that describe the typical career paths. This information is also made publicly available via FutureMe - a tool that allows people to explore possible career opportunities and identify professions that may be interesting for them to work in. One of the challenges when developing the job recommendation system is to collect explicit feedback and thus understanding (i) whether a recommended job was relevant for a user and (ii) whether the user was a good candidate for the job. We thus started to stronger involve users in providing feedback and build a feedback cycle that allows the recommender system to automatically adapt to the feedback that the crowd of users is providing. By displaying explanations about why certain items were suggested, we furthermore aim to increase transparency of how the recommender system works.},

  abstract = {Agency (A) and communion (C) are fundamental content dimensions. We propose a facet-model that differentiates A into assertiveness (AA) and competence (AC) and C into warmth (CW) and morality (CM). We tested the model in a cross-cultural study by comparing data from Asia, Australia, Europe, and the USA (overall N = 1.808). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported our model. Both the two-factor model and the four-factor model showed good fit indices across countries. Participants answered additional measures intended to demonstrate the fruitfulness of distinguishing the facets. The findings support the model’s construct validity by positioning the fundamental dimensions and their facets within a network of self-construal, values, impression management, and the Big Five personality factors: In all countries, A was related to independent self-construal and to agentic values, C was related to interdependent self-construal and to communal values. Regarding the facets, AA was always related to A values, but the association of AC with A values fell below our effect size criterion in four of the five countries. A (both AA and AC) was related to agentic impression management. However, C (both CW and CM) was neither related to communal nor to agentic impression management. Regarding the Big Five personality factors, A was related to emotional stability, to extraversion, and to conscientiousness. C was related to agreeableness and to extraversion. AA was more strongly related to emotional stability and extraversion than AC. CW was more strongly related to extraversion and agreeableness than CM. We could also show that self-esteem was more related to AA than AC; and that it was related to CM, but not to CW. Our research shows that (a) the fundamental dimensions of A and C are stable across cultures; and (b) that the here proposed distinction of facets of A and C is fruitful in analyzing self-perception. The here proposed measure, the AC-IN, may be a useful tool in this research area. Applications of the facet model in social perception research are discussed.},

But how might prospective employers view job applicants who have skills and qualities that they associate with older adults? This article draws on social role theory, age stereotypes and research on hiring biases, and reports three studies using age-diverse North American participants. These studies reveal that: (1) positive older age stereotype characteristics are viewed less favorably as criteria for job hire, (2) even when the job role is low-status, a younger stereotype profile tends to be preferred, and (3) an older stereotype profile is only considered hirable when the role is explicitly cast as subordinate to that of a candidate with a younger age profile. Implications for age-positive selection procedures and ways to reduce the impact of implicit age biases are discussed.},

It becomes necessary that organisations practices should not be driven by need of one generation more than the other. This needs understanding of whether different generations working together in organisation have different personality traits. The aim of this research is to investigate whether differences in personality and organisational commitment exist in generation X \&amp;Y employees in private sectors organisation. The research design includes using the 16 Personality Factor Questionnaires by Cattell (1943) and the Organisational Commitment Questionnaire by Allen and Meyer (1990). The method includes examining cross-sectional differences in personality and organisational commitment with respect to generation X\&amp;amp;Y. The results revealed there was significant difference in personality and organisational commitment between Gen X and Gen Y. Result also depicted that personality traits affect organisational commitment of Gen X employees, but personality traits do not affect organisational commitment of Gen Y employees. In case of Gen Y employees, organisational factors are more important to enhance organisational commitment such as working environment, culture, reward system, career growth among others. Managers and HR professionals may find the study useful to construct HR practices which can help in improving organisational commitment of employees.},

In this edited volume, we narrow the scope of attention by focusing on what game theorist Ian Bogost has called "persuasive games", that is, gaming practices that combine the dissemination of information with attempts to engage players in particular attitudes and behaviors. This volume offers a multifaceted reflection on persuasive gaming, that is, on the process of these particular games being played by players. The purpose is to better understand when and how digital games can be used for persuasion, by further exploring persuasive games and some other kinds of persuasive playful interaction as well. The book critically integrates what has been accomplished in separate research traditions to offer a multidisciplinary approach to understanding persuasive gaming that is closely linked to developments in the industry by including the exploration of relevant case studies.},

  abstract = {This chapter lays out a research agenda in the sociology of work for a type of data and organizational intermediary: work platforms. As an example, the authors employ a case study of the adoption of automated hiring platforms (AHPs) in which the authors distinguish between promises and existing practices. The authors draw on two main methods to do so: critical discourse analysis and affordance critique. The authors collected and examined a mix of trade, popular press, and corporate archives; 135 texts in total. The analysis reveals that work platforms offer five core affordances to management: (1) structured data fields optimized for capture and portability within organizations; (2) increased legibility of activity qua data captured inside and outside the workplace; (3) information asymmetry between labor and management; (4) an “ecosystem” design that supports the development of limited-use applications for specific domains; and (5) the standardization of managerial techniques between workplaces. These combine to create a managerial frame for workers as fungible human capital, available on demand and easily ported between job tasks and organizations. While outlining the origin of platform studies within media and communication studies, the authors demonstrate the specific tools the sociology of work brings to the study of platforms within the workplace. The authors conclude by suggesting avenues for future sociological research not only on hiring platforms, but also on other work platforms such as those supporting automated scheduling and customer relationship management.},

The GPT-2 wasn’t a particularly novel architecture – it’s architecture is very similar to the decoder-only transformer. The GPT2 was, however, a very large, transformer-based language model trained on a massive dataset. In this post, we’ll look at the architecture that enabled the model to produce its results. We will go into the depths of its self-attention layer. And then we’ll look at applications for the decoder-only transformer beyond language modeling. My goal here is to also supplement my earlier post, The Illustrated Transformer, with more visuals explaining the inner-workings of transformers, and how they’ve evolved since the original paper. My hope is that this visual language will hopefully make it easier to explain later Transformer-based models as their inner-workings continue to evolve.},

Sequence-to-sequence models are deep learning models that have achieved a lot of success in tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and image captioning. Google Translate started using such a model in production in late 2016. These models are explained in the two pioneering papers (Sutskever et al., 2014, Cho et al., 2014). I found, however, that understanding the model well enough to implement it requires unraveling a series of concepts that build on top of each other. I thought that a bunch of these ideas would be more accessible if expressed visually. That’s what I aim to do in this post. You’ll need some previous understanding of deep learning to get through this post.

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to explore the current use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the recruitment and selection of candidates. More specifically, this research investigates the level, rate and potential adoption areas for AI-tools across the hiring process. Design/methodology/approach To fulfill that purpose, a two-step approach was adopted. First, the literature was extensively reviewed to identify potential AI-application areas supporting the recruitment and selection (R\&S) process. Second, primary research was carried out in the form of semi-structured thematic interviews with different types of R\&S specialists including HR managers, consultants and academics to evaluate how much of the AI-applications areas identified in the literature review are being used in practice. Findings This study presents a multitude of findings. First, it identifies 11 areas across the R\&S Process where AI-applications can be applied. However, practitioners currently seem to rely mostly on three: chatbots, screening software and task automation tools. Second, most companies adopting these AI-tools tend to be larger, tech-focussed and/or innovative firms. Finally, despite the exponential rate of AI-adoption, companies have yet to reach an inflection point as they currently show reluctance to invest in that technology for R\&S. Research limitations/implications Due to the qualitative and exploratory nature behind the research, this study displays a significant amount of subjectivity, and therefore, lacks generalisability. Despite this limitation, this study opens the door to many opportunities for academic research, both qualitative and quantitative. Originality/value This paper addresses the huge research gap surrounding AI in R\&S, pertaining specifically to the scarcity and poor quality of the current academic literature. Furthermore, this research provides a comprehensive overview of the state of AI in R\&S, which will be helpful for academics and practitioners looking to rapidly gain a holistic understanding of AI in R\&S.},

Nevertheless, the literature of IoT still lacks studies on the behavioral aspect that explain the customers\&rsquo; perception towards IoT adoption and focuses more on technological aspect. The main goal of this study is to examine the factors that influence consumer trust and their role in the adoption of IoT technology. A conceptual trust model that encompasses the major factors affecting trust towards IoT technology adoption has been presented. The model is composed of three dimensions of factors that we assume will influence the level of trust which are: product related factors, social influence related factors and security related factors. This framework is validated through surveying consumers\&rsquo; opinions, which provide views and feedback regarding factors influencing their trust towards this technology. The model can assist researchers to further investigate the trust issues and create a trustworthy literature to guide IoT products\&rsquo; development and marketing strategies that are focused on the consumer\&rsquo;s requirements.},

  abstract = {Career motivation theory (London, 1983), applies motivation theory to understanding career plans, behaviors and decisions of employees, such as searching for and accepting a job, deciding to stay with an organization, revising career plans, seeking new job experiences, and setting and trying to accomplish career goals. Career motivation is defined in terms of tree major components: career resilience, career insight and career identity. Each component has multiple elements. Understanding how each element is related to employees’ affective commitment to the organization and their job satisfaction may help fostering employee motivation and improve the effectiveness of human resources. To date, there have been several conceptual studies theorizing the content and construct of career motivation. However, there has been limited empirical work to examine the relationship between the elements of career motivation and key employee behavior such as employment and turnover intentions, job satisfaction, organizational commitment and work performance. Accordingly, this study examines the relationships between the components of career motivation, employees’ affective commitment and their job satisfaction, while controlling their demographic characteristics such as age, gender, income and organizational tenure. For this aim, we conducted a field research on 250 employees working in various industries. Research results showed that career motivation has a positive correlation with organizational commitment and job satisfaction. Individual characteristics except respondents’ gender did not exert any significant association with career motivation. Theoretical and managerial implications of the findings are discussed.},

Given the importance of highlighting accomplishments and skills for professional advancement, our research revisits the classical question of equal opportunity with a modern dataset to examine how women leverage LinkedIn, a professional social networking site. We first apply propensity score matching methods to identify a subset of similarly qualified female and male U.S. users who recently graduated/will be graduating (2011-2017) from a top-ranked MBA program as indicated on their LinkedIn profile. We then analyze gender differences in online self-promotion choices, an often overlooked aspect of understanding the role of gender in the professional hiring pipeline. Among matched subsets of female and male users, we find that females are less likely relative to males to utilize data fields that require writing in free-form such as the Summary and Job Description fields. However, we find for most universities that females and males are equally likely to include more structured data fields such as Honors and Skills, and for some universities females are more likely to include at least one Skill. This work begins to quantify gender biases in user-provided data and introduces important considerations for how self-presentation choices affect professional opportunity in online hiring platforms.},

Past research has favored explanatory modeling, considering it a prediction-oriented approach; until recently, predictive analytics has been poorly understood and widely underappreciated. Research on IS for prediction-oriented modeling like predictive analytics remains rare, despite its potential for development and utility. Our research addresses the capacity of predictive analytics for advancing technology acceptance modeling by assessing predictive power, evaluating the current frameworks, and introducing new constructs. This research formulates a unique data-driven approach that utilizes machine learning (ML) and predictive analytics-based modeling to empirically predict end users’ acceptance of consumer-use technology in a non-organizational setting using the following steps. First, a thorough analysis of IS literature was conducted to explore the constructs of technology use in various contexts. Second, the Twitter API and interviews were utilized to extract new constructs and evaluate the content of current models of technology acceptance. Third, a unique technology acceptance model of thirty-seven constructs was developed and tested on thirty-two personal technologies with heterogeneous subjects. Fourth, ML algorithms estimated the predictive power of the model and ranked the influence of its variables, achieving an R2 of 0.97 and an error rate of 0.04. Thirteen new constructs were successfully introduced, including eight technology characteristics. Four other constructs were reinstated, presenting the utility of the ML approach to contribute to research. Ranking the thirty-seven constructs by applying a sensitivity analysis on the basis of partial derivatives showed the differences between the predictive model and the explanatory model of personal technology acceptance. The proposed approach demonstrates the capacity of ML to formulate a complex model of personal technology acceptance, which further develops technology acceptance models.},

  abstract = {Topic modeling is used for discovering latent semantic structure, usually referred to as topics, in a large collection of documents. The most widely used methods are Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis. Despite their popularity they have several weaknesses. In order to achieve optimal results they often require the number of topics to be known, custom stop-word lists, stemming, and lemmatization. Additionally these methods rely on bag-of-words representation of documents which ignore the ordering and semantics of words. Distributed representations of documents and words have gained popularity due to their ability to capture semantics of words and documents. We present \$\textbackslash texttt\{top2vec\}\$, which leverages joint document and word semantic embedding to find \$\textbackslash textit\{topic vectors\}\$. This model does not require stop-word lists, stemming or lemmatization, and it automatically finds the number of topics. The resulting topic vectors are jointly embedded with the document and word vectors with distance between them representing semantic similarity. Our experiments demonstrate that \$\textbackslash texttt\{top2vec\}\$ finds topics which are significantly more informative and representative of the corpus trained on than probabilistic generative models.},

A common understanding of genre is that it relates to the content of books, but this resource allows us to view genre as an intersection of user communities and reader values and interests. We explore different methods of computational genre measurement within the open space of user-created tags. We measure overlap between books, tags, and users, and we also measure the homogeneity of communities associated with genre tags and correlate this homogeneity with reviewing behavior.Finally, by analyzing the text of reviews, we identify the thematic signatures of genres on LibraryThing, revealing similarities and differences between them. These measurements are intended to elucidate the genre conceptions of the users, not, as in prior work, to normalize the tags or enforce a hierarchy. We find that LibraryThing users make sense of genre through a variety of values and expectations, many of which fall outside common definitions and understandings of genre.},

Analyzing information from over 2.5 million job advertisements on three different employment search websites in Mexico, we find evidence that advertisements seeking “communal” characteristics, stereotypically associated with women, specify lower salaries than those seeking “agentic” characteristics, stereotypically associated with men. Given the continued widespread use of gender-targeted advertisements in Mexico, we use a random forest algorithm to predict whether nontargeted ads are in fact directed toward men or women, based on the language they use. We find that the non-targeted ads for which we predict gender show larger salary gaps (8- 35 percent) than explicitly gender-targeted ads (0-13 percent). If women are segregated into occupations deemed appropriate for their gender, this pay gap between jobs requiring communal versus agentic characteristics translates into a gender pay gap in the labor market.},

More specifically, it investigates the language of 39 Danish top executive job advertisements and considers which leadership identities are projected as desirable or necessary. This is done by carrying out two interlinked studies: a semantic field analysis of the sections in the job advertisements describing the leadership traits of the ideal candidate (Study 1) and a study of MBA students' responses to extracts from the advertisements as far as gender is concerned (Study 2). Semantic field analysis reveals that all the job advertisements are gender-biased and that most traits described in the advertisements are associated with traditional or stereotypical masculine attributes. Study 2 confirms this finding, as respondents (MBA students) assign a masculine identity to the vast majority of the extracts from the job advertisements.},

  abstract = {Performance metrics are usually evaluated only after the neural network learning process using an error cost function. This procedure can result in suboptimal model selection, particularly for imbalanced classification problems. This work proposes the direct use of these metrics as cost functions, which are often derived from the confusion matrix. Commonly used metrics are covered, namely AUC, G-mean, F1-score and AG-mean. The only implementation change for model training occurs in the backpropagation error term. The results were compared to the standard MLP using the Rprop learning algorithm, SMOTE, SMTTL, WWE and RAMOBoost. Sixteen classical benchmark datasets were used in the experiments. Based on average ranks, the proposed formulation outperformed Rprop and all sampling strategies, namely SMOTE, SMTTL and WWE, for all metrics. These results were statistically confirmed for AUC and G-mean in relation to Rprop. For F1-score and AG-mean, all algorithms were considered statistically equivalent. The proposal was also superior to RAMOBoost for G-mean given average ranks. However, it was statistically faster than RAMOBoost for all metrics. It was also faster than SMTTL and statistically equivalent to Rprop, SMOTE and WWE. More, the solutions obtained are generally non-dominated ones compared to all other techniques, for all metrics. The results showed that the direct use of performance metrics as cost functions for neural network training favors generalization capacity and also computation time in imbalanced classification problems. Its extension to other performance metrics derived directly from the confusion matrix is straightforward.},

In two studies, we tested the proposition that perceived competence has an indirect effect on willingness for intergroup contact through its effect on realistic threat, and that perceived warmth moderates this relationship. In Study 1, Hong Kong students (N = 144) rated the perceived warmth and competence of an outgroup, Mainland Chinese students, as well as the extent to which they perceived the group as presenting a realistic threat, and willingness for contact with them. In Study 2 (N = 205), we attempted to manipulate the warmth (high vs. low) and competence (high vs. low) of an unfamiliar outgroup, and tested the effects on realistic threat and willingness for intergroup contact. In both studies, we found an interaction effect between warmth and competence in the prediction of realistic threat. When the outgroup was perceived as warm, competence was found to have a negative association with realistic threat (Study 1), whereas when the outgroup was perceived as lacking warmth, competence was found to have a positive association with realistic threat (Study 2). In both studies, perceived warmth moderated the indirect effect of perceived competence on willingness for intergroup contact. Implications for the role of warmth and competence stereotypes in threat perception and prejudice are discussed.},

In this study, we examine how pre-established news frames continue to inform journalists’ framing practices despite the ongoing arrival of novel, often contravening information. Specifically, we argue that dominant frames rooted in pre-existing cultural perceptions and strategic elite frame building have the capacity to overpower an open-minded appraisal of available information. In a qualitative, diachronic analysis of US, British and Russian news coverage of the 2013 Syrian Chemical Weapons crisis, we analyze journalists’ strategies for negotiating between pre-established news frames and novel, discrepant claims and observations. We find that most claims that directly contravened existing frames were either ignored or discounted by questioning the credibility of sources. By contrast, unforeseen events effectively challenged the predictive validity of dominant frames, necessitating adaptations with often far-reaching consequences for the frame. Observed patterns were consistent across outlets, despite the different journalistic cultures and embedding media systems and political settings. Our findings illuminate the important role of journalists’ pre-established ideas, which shape their news selection and framing practices, contributing to the maintenance of existing news narratives.},

  abstract = {Diabetes mellitus is a fast-growing disease affecting millions of people around the globe. According to the statistics obtained from the International Diabetes Federation, the growth of diabetic cases around the world is estimated to be around 10.2\% (578 million) by 2030 and 10.9\% (700 million) by 2045. Machine learning techniques can be used for early diagnosis of diabetes so that individuals can adapt to better lifestyle habits and diet plan to prevent further complications of symptoms. In this paper we have implemented an efficient model to classify type-2 diabetes using a hybrid approach. The dataset which is relatively imbalanced with respect to the number of diabetic or non-diabetic individuals was obtained from the Biostatistics program of Vanderbilt University, USA which contains parameters like Glucose, Age, Cholesterol, Weight, Waist/Hip ratio of 390 African-American individuals. The features from the dataset were obtained by filter and wrapper methods. The dataset was balanced by applying oversampling and undersampling methods. A voting ensemble model consisting of 5 algorithms was then used as a classifier with model validation done using stratified K-fold technique. The model's performance was assessed using recall, precision, F1 score and accuracy. The results obtained by comparison of the models with and without sampling have shown significant improvements in recall. The main motive is to improve recall and have reasonable precision at the same time.},

  abstract = {Recent literature has underscored the importance of dataset documentation work for machine learning, and part of this work involves addressing "documentation debt" for datasets that have been used widely but documented sparsely. This paper aims to help address documentation debt for BookCorpus, a popular text dataset for training large language models. Notably, researchers have used BookCorpus to train OpenAI's GPT-N models and Google's BERT models, even though little to no documentation exists about the dataset's motivation, composition, collection process, etc. We offer a preliminary datasheet that provides key context and information about BookCorpus, highlighting several notable deficiencies. In particular, we find evidence that (1) BookCorpus likely violates copyright restrictions for many books, (2) BookCorpus contains thousands of duplicated books, and (3) BookCorpus exhibits significant skews in genre representation. We also find hints of other potential deficiencies that call for future research, including problematic content, potential skews in religious representation, and lopsided author contributions. While more work remains, this initial effort to provide a datasheet for BookCorpus adds to growing literature that urges more careful and systematic documentation for machine learning datasets.},

  abstract = {“Stereotype threat” is often thought of as a singular construct, with moderators and mechanisms that are stable across groups and domains. However, this is not always true. To illustrate this, the current review focuses on the stereotype threat that older adults face about their cognitive abilities. Drawing upon the multithreat framework, I first provide evidence that this is a self-concept threat and not a group-reputation threat. Because this differs from the forms of stereotype threat experienced by other groups (e.g., the threat that minority students face about their intellectual abilities), the moderators of stereotype threat observed in other groups (i.e., group identification) do not always generalize to age-based stereotype threat about cognitive decline. Looking beyond the forms of stereotype threat elicited, this review also provides evidence that the mechanisms underlying stereotype-threat effects may vary across the adult life span. Because of age-related improvements in emotion-regulation abilities, stereotype threat does not seem to reduce older adults’ executive-control resources. Overall, this review highlights the need to approach the concept of stereotype threat with more granularity, allowing researchers to design more effective stereotype-threat interventions. It will also shed light on why certain stereotype threat effects “fail to replicate” across domains or groups.},

We argue that entity theories belong to a broader set of beliefs that represent differences between people in terms of underlying essences. New measures of three essentialist beliefs (i.e., in the biological basis, discreteness, and informativeness of human attributes) were developed in a pilot study. In the main study, these beliefs were found to covary with entity theories, and to predict the endorsement and innate explanation of stereotypes. Essentialist beliefs predicted stereotype endorsement independently of popular stereotyping-related individual difference measures, and in a way that was not reducible to the effect of entity theories. We propose that research on implicit person theories can be placed within an encompassing framework of psychological essentialism.},

Using the configurational approach, we identify the evolution of different theme based causal configurations in conceptual and empirical research and the outcomes of AI-HRM interaction.

Recommender system design choices examined include computer-generated personalized recommendations, user-customized recommendations, and full or limited news information environments based on recommendations. Results from an online mock election experiment with Ohio adult Internet users indicate increased selective exposure when using personalized news systems. However, portals recommending news based on explicit user customization result in significantly higher counterattitudinal news exposure. Expected positive effects on elaboration and indirect effects on knowledge through elaboration are found only in personalized news recommender systems that display only recommended headlines. Lastly, personalized news recommender system use has a negative direct effect on knowledge.},

Using a comprehensive search of more than 400 contemporary academic and business press articles, the paper reviews relevant research and reassesses the “talent war.” We posit that the dominant approaches to the “talent war” based on a scarcity state of mind and action, often characterized by a tactical and exclusive top talent or “star” focus, are being challenged by the emergence of a more evolutionary paradigm. This new paradigm adopts more strategic, innovative, cooperative and generative approaches which we describe as creative ‘talent solutions.’ The paper also highlights implications for future research, teaching and development in the field.},

In this context of voluntary Web site adoption and use, we provide a more precise understanding of the nomological network related to the cognitive variables (both beliefs and attitudes) that precede this use. Designers and engineers need to be concerned not just with building an objectively better Web site but also with building a Web site that conveys desirable characteristics. Although the theory of reasoned action has been acknowledged as the underlying theory for technology acceptance and some trust research, past studies integrating these two theories have omitted important variables from their models and have posited different causal relationships among model variables. This research argues for the reinclusion and/or clarification of belief and attitude constructs relevant to technology acceptance and trust research streams, explains why these constructs are critical for understanding causality in such models, proposes an integration model that is consistent with this argument, and finally tests this model in a context exploring initial reactions to an e-vendor and evaluates the relative importance of trust and technology acceptance variables in predicting user intentions.},

BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.},

Employees can, however, show more or less reciprocity towards their organisation. We assess the role of generational membership (Baby Boomers vs. Generation X) as a determinant of reciprocity. Boomers began work when jobs were “for life”; they value job security and tend to rely on the organisation for their career direction. In contrast, Generation X generally commenced work during the recession of the early 1990s, so they feel they cannot rely on one employer for a lifetime of employment. We investigate the extent to which generational differences in work and career values moderate the relationship between career development satisfaction and organisational commitment or neglect of work. We find, using data from 1,530 employees in one organisation, that Generation X are more likely to exchange high career development satisfaction for higher levels of organisational commitment and lower neglect of work than are Boomers.},

We found that specific types of commands were made more often at particular times of day and that commands in some domains increased in length over time as participants tried out new ways to interact with their devices, yet exploration of new topics was low. Four distinct user groups also emerged based on using the device more or less during the day vs. in the evening or using particular categories. We conclude by comparing smart speaker use to a similar study of smartphone use and offer implications for the design of new smart speaker assistants and skills, highlighting specific areas where both manufacturers and skill providers can focus in this domain.},

Based on an integrative review of the literature on stereotyping and biased language use, we propose the Social Categories and Stereotypes Communication (SCSC) framework. The framework integrates largely independent areas of literature and explicates the linguistic processes through which social-category stereotypes are shared and maintained. We distinguish two groups of biases in language use that jointly feed and maintain three fundamental cognitive variables in (shared) social-category cognition: perceived category entitativity, stereotype content, and perceived essentialism of associated stereotypic characteristics. These are: (1) Biases in linguistic labels used to denote categories, within which we discuss biases in (a) label content and (b) linguistic form of labels; (2) Biases in describing behaviors and characteristics of categorized individuals, within which we discuss biases in (a) communication content (i.e., what information is communicated), and (b) linguistic form of descriptions (i.e., how is information formulated). Together, these biases create a self-perpetuating cycle in which social-category stereotypes are shared and maintained. The framework allows for a better understanding of stereotype maintaining biases in natural language. We discuss various opportunities for further research.},

  abstract = {ENGLISH ABSTRACT: This study stems from an urgent need to understand which factors contribute to talented employees’ intention to quit, and what organisations can do to ensure the retention of such talent. Difficulties regarding the retention of talented employees have become a worldwide challenge. The retention of talented individuals has become a primary source of gaining a competitive advantage. The increased focus on talent management practices has become a wide spread phenomenon worldwide, including South Africa. History, cultural heritage, politics and the economic environment are but only a few factors that collectively now shape the nature and complexity of the South African labour market. A context, notorious and respected for its diversity and the struggles that have sprouted from it, poses formidable challenges for organisations competing in the global market. A multitude of factors, controllable and uncontrollable, contribute to increased levels of employee turnover in all sectors and organisations in South Africa. Organisations and top management can position themselves, by implementing action plans and organisational structures, to identify and coordinate such controllable factors. Strategies and processes can be implemented to address the increasing challenges regarding the retention of valuable talent. The implementation of structural talent management programmes have proven to address and overcome retention challenges. The crucial role of line management in implementing and fostering a culture of talent retention has also been proven. The foundation of a talent management competency model, for the purpose of addressing and solving this issue, has been laid down. Additional research has been done in order to reevaluate and elaborate on the existing knowledge of such a competency model. This study aims to once again re-evaluate the originally proposed model as well as any extensions that may have been developed by other researchers. The primary objective of the current study consequently was to expand on the existing model as proposed by Oehley (2007) and Smuts (2011). Factors external to the organisational environment were added to the model in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the complexity underlying the determinants of intention to quit. Only a subset of the hypothesised intention to quit structural model was then empirically tested. In the initial model only nine of the nineteen paths were empirically corroborated. The initial reduced model was subsequently revised by deleting various paths that were found to be statistically insignificant (p {$>$} .05) and by adding various paths suggested by the modification indices. The final model produced exact fit. Seven of the nineteen paths in the final model were not empirically corroborated. Suggestions for future research are made by introducing additional variables that could be included into a future model.},

The second section of the paper offers a comparison between traditional cases of discrimination and this new kind of algorithmic discrimination and three solutions for mitigating the risk of discrimination in automated hiring practices, i.e., transparency, careful testing for biases that could have ingrained themselves in the software used in the hiring process, and by ensuring that the final decision is made by a human and not a machine.},

In this article, we suggest that clients can extract greater benefits when practitioners adopt more sophisticated approaches to strengths intervention. We introduce an alternative approach that we call ‘strengths development’. This approach is distinguished by the view that strengths are not fixed traits across settings and time (the dominant, contemporary approach to personality). Instead, we adopt dynamic, within-person approaches from personality science to research, assessment, and interventions on strengths. Specifically, strengths are highly contextual phenomena that emerge in distinctive patterns alongside particular goals, interests, values, and situational factors. Strengths are potentials for excellence that can be cultivated through enhanced awareness, accessibility, and effort. Finally, we outline potential psychological risks associated with the strengths perspective that are worthy of explicit discussion with clients.},

Third, recent and near-future advances in AI-enabled recruiting have improved recruiting efficiency to the point that managers ignore them or procrastinate their utilization at their own peril. In addition to explaining the forces that have pushed AI-enabled recruiting systems from nice to necessary, we outline the key strategic steps managers need to take in order to capture its main benefits.},

We provide a framework for formally “declaring” the analytically relevant features of a research design in a demonstrably complete manner, with applications to qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods research. The approach to design declaration we describe requires defining a model of the world (M), an inquiry (I), a data strategy (D), and an answer strategy (A). Declaration of these features in code provides sufficient information for researchers and readers to use Monte Carlo techniques to diagnose properties such as power, bias, accuracy of qualitative causal inferences, and other “diagnosands.” Ex ante declarations can be used to improve designs and facilitate preregistration, analysis, and reconciliation of intended and actual analyses. Ex post declarations are useful for describing, sharing, reanalyzing, and critiquing existing designs. We provide open-source software, DeclareDesign, to implement the proposed approach.},

These augmented user and job profiles are then analyzed in order to develop numerical overlap features each with strong discriminating power, and in sum with maximal coverage. The resulting feature scores are then combined into a single Bright Score using a custom algorithm, where the feature weights are derived from a nation-wide and controlled study in which we collected a large sample of human judgments on real resume-job pairings.

  abstract = {Part-time jobs are common among partnered women in many countries. There are two opposing views on the efficiency implications of so many women working part-time. The negative view is that part-time jobs imply wastage of resources and underutilization of investments in human capital since many part-time working women are highly educated. The positive view is that, without the existence of part-time jobs, female labor force participation would be substantially lower since women confronted with the choice between a full-time job and zero working hours would opt for the latter. In the Netherlands, the majority of partnered working women have a part-time job. Our paper investigates, from a supply-side perspective, if the current situation of abundant part-time work in the Netherlands is likely to be a transitional phase that will culminate in many women working full-time. Our main results indicate that partnered women in part-time work have high levels of job satisfaction, a low desire to change their working hours, and live in partnerships in which household production is highly gendered. Taken together, our results suggest that part-time jobs are what most Dutch women want.},

The standard human capital model predicts that, as a result of human capital obsolescence, mobility becomes more costly when workers become older. We measure and interpret how changing job opportunities across 96 occupations affect different age and skill groups. Older workers end up in shrinking occupations, in occupations with a lower share of high-skilled workers, in occupations facing a higher threat of offshoring tasks abroad, more focus on routine-intensive tasks and less rewarding job content. This process is not only observed for the oldest group of workers, but for workers aged 40 and above. Observing older workers in declining occupations is to a large extent a market outcome, but declining job opportunities in terms of less satisfying working conditions and job tasks and content could potentially raise incentives to retire early.},

For a long time, however, the possibilities of user-content interactivity have been limited due to the one-directionality of the traditional mass media. Moreover, a re-occurring question is to what extent less-versus-more entertaining forms of news evoke audience engagement. This study analyzes the user-content engagement on online platforms in response to journalistic content and infotainment; more concretely, we compare whether the satire genre is more likely to evoke user-content interactivity than regular news and partisan news shows. To test our hypotheses, a large-scale data analysis of social media posts by a wide variety of American TV shows on Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter has been conducted. Results demonstrate satire’s potential to encourage user-content interactivity: Satire videos generated (a) more likes and (b) more comments than the clips of regular news. However, we also find that (c) satire videos are related to less controversy, which arguably indicates that satire hampers the exchange of diverse ideas. Compared to partisan news – which shares many features of satire, but often lacks the humor component – satire elicits more likes but less commentary and less controversy.},

  abstract = {Research on media framing of policy issues has flourished. Yet the varied approaches to conceptualizing and operationalizing issue frames that make this literature rich also hinder its advancement. Here, we document the benefits of a two-tiered method: the first level accounts for issue-specific frames, while the second level tracks frames that generalize across issues. For this study, we draw on generalizable frames from prospect theory (loss vs. gain frames) and social identity theory (self-referential vs. otherreferential frames). We discuss the theoretical merits of a two-tiered approach, arguing that it should yield compound insights greater than the sum of its parts. Applying this method to newspaper coverage of the war on terror, we find a strong trend at the generalizable level: media framing of the war shifted over time from a predominant use of “fear” (self-referential loss) frames to an increasing use of “charity” (other-referential gain) frames. Our approach further reveals that the fear frames used in the lead-up to the Iraq War were not driven by issue-specific frames related to terrorism or weapons of mass destruction as we might have thought, but rather by frames related to the anticipated threats to U.S. troops. This study sharpens our understanding of how framing of the war evolved, but more broadly it suggests that a two-tiered approach could be applied both within and across policy issues to advance our understanding of the framing process.},

Finally, we outline the disadvantages and advantages of thematic analysis.

Some scholars have explained this paradox by the existence of deeply rooted or intrinsic gender differences in preferences that materialize more easily in countries where economic constraints are more limited. In line with a strand of research in sociology, we show instead that it can be explained by cross-country differences in essentialist gender norms regarding math aptitudes and appropriate occupational choices. To this aim, we propose a measure of the prevalence and extent of internalization of the stereotype that “math is not for girls” at the country level. This is done using individual-level data on the math attitudes of 300,000 15-y-old female and male students in 64 countries. The stereotype associating math to men is stronger in more egalitarian and developed countries. It is also strongly associated with various measures of female underrepresentation in math-intensive fields and can therefore entirely explain the gender-equality paradox. We suggest that economic development and gender equality in rights go hand-in-hand with a reshaping rather than a suppression of gender norms, with the emergence of new and more horizontal forms of social differentiation across genders.},

In this regard, this paper tries to look at the factors that associated with the usage of big data analytics, by synchronizing TAM with organizational learning capabilities (OLC) framework. These models are applied on the construct, intended usage of big data and also the mediation effect of the OLC constructs is assessed. The data for the study is collected from the students pertaining to information technology disciplines at University of Liverpool, online programme. Though, invitation to participate e-mails are sent to 1035 students, only 359 members responded back with filled questionnaires. This study uses structural equation modelling and multivariate regression using ordinary least squares estimation to test the proposed hypotheses using the latest statistical software R. It is proved from the analysis that compared to other models, model 4 (which is constructed by using the constructs of OLC and TAM frameworks) is able to explain 44\% variation in the usage pattern of big data. In addition to this, the mediation test performed revealed that the interaction between OLC dimensions and TAM dimensions on intended usage of big data has no mediation effect. Thus, this work provided inputs to the research community to look into the relation between the constructs of OLC framework and the selection of big data technology.},

  abstract = {When unknown groups and equal status groups are compared by contrasting one group (“the effect to be explained”) against another (“the linguistic norm”), the group positioned as the norm is sometimes perceived as more powerful, more agentic, and as less communal. Such perceptions may contribute to status-linked stereotypes, as group differences are spontaneously described by positioning higher-status groups as the linguistic norm. Here, 103 participants considered gender differences in status to be larger and more legitimate and applied gender stereotypes more readily upon reading about gender differences in leadership that were framed around a male rather than a female linguistic norm. These effects did not generalize to 113 participants who read about gender differences in leisure time preferences framed around either norm. Jointly, these results suggest that the effects of linguistic framing on perceived group status and power and on group stereotypes generalize to domains where there are real differences in status, and contexts in which higher-status groups are the default standard for comparison.

Three multidimensional scaling studies address this question and suggest an interaction with valence: While negative communal content is more densely clustered than negative agentic content, we find no differences in density between positive communal and positive agentic content. In addition to enhancing our understanding of the fundamental dimensions and their structural representation, this research might open a new perspective on old questions regarding person perception and implicit personality theories. © 2013 Hogrefe Publishing.},

Drawing from an analysis of six years of US media coverage of credit card borrowers throughout the recent financial crisis, we show how categorization processes facilitate gender-based status differences by categorizing male and female credit card borrowers based on competence. We find that three dimensions of competence—savviness, responsibility, and agency—are constructed through two discursive mechanisms: accounts and vocabularies. Additionally, we highlight how vocabularies work to amplify stereotype-consistent accounts, yet undermine stereotype-inconsistent accounts. We contribute to research on institutional maintenance by highlighting the role of categorization processes in the reproduction of institutionalized relations of inequality. Further, we contribute to research on gender inequality by offering an in-depth examination of the micro-processes involved in the social construction of gender-based status differences. In this way, we shed new light on the cultural means through which gender inequalities are reproduced.},

The last decade has seen a growth in AI-based applications proliferating the HRM function, triggering an exciting new stream of research on topics such as the social presence of AI and robotics, effects of AI adoption on individual and business level outcomes, and evaluating AI-enabled HRM practices. Adopting these technologies has resulted in how work is organised in local and international firms, noting opportunities for employees and firms’ resource utilisation, decision-making, and problem-solving. However, despite a growing interest in scholarship, research on AI-based technologies for HRM is limited and fragmented. Further research is needed that analyses the role of AI-assisted applications in HRM functions and human-AI interactions in large multinational enterprises diffusing such innovations. In response to these combined issues—the fragmented nature of research and limited extant literature, we present a systematic review on the theme of this special issue and offer a nuanced understating of what is known, yet to be known, and future research directions to frame a future research agenda for international HRM. We develop a conceptual framework that integrates research on AI applications in HRM and offers a cohesive base for future research endeavours. We also develop a set of testable propositions that serve as directions for future research.},

Our analysis uses methods from computational linguistics and machine learning to directly identify, in a field-experiment setting, ageist stereotypes that underlie age discrimination in hiring. We find evidence that language related to stereotypes of older workers sometimes predicts discrimination against older workers. For men, our evidence points most strongly to age stereotypes about physical ability, communication skills, and technology predicting age discrimination, and for women, age stereotypes about communication skills and technology. The method we develop provides a framework for applied researchers analyzing textual data, highlighting the usefulness of various computer science techniques for empirical economics research.},

By automating the coding of frames in news, SML facilitates the incorporation of large-scale content analysis into framing research, even if financial resources are scarce. This furthers a more integrated investigation of framing processes conceptually as well as methodologically. We conduct several experiments in which we automate the coding of four generic frames that are operationalised as a set of indicator questions. In doing so, we compare two approaches to modelling the coherence between indicator questions and frames as an SML task. The results of our experiments show that SML is well suited to automate frame coding but that coding performance is dependent on the way SML is implemented.},

A total of 211 women undergraduate students majoring in engineering fields (73\% White, mean age=21years) responded to measures of stigma consciousness and stereotype vulnerability as proxies for stereotype threat, along with measures of self-efficacy for coping with barriers (CWB) and academic self-efficacy. Stigma consciousness (in the form of awareness of sexism and negative attitudes about women), but not stereotype vulnerability, negatively related to women's confidence in their abilities to complete a college degree in a engineering major field. Results of a moderation model indicated a significant interaction of CWB and stigma consciousness on academic self-efficacy, with no such interaction effect for stereotype vulnerability. Our findings add to the proximal contextual barriers framework within Social Cognitive Career Theory by uncovering the existence of negative relationships between consciousness of discrimination due to group identity and academic self-efficacy. Promoting positive identity and constructive interaction with the environment may support women's career development in engineering fields.},

This carries implications for labour market inequality, since previous research shows that soft skills are not valued equally across race and gender. This work explores the role of soft skills in job advertisements by drawing on methods from computational science as well as on theoretical and empirical insights from economics, sociology and psychology. We present a semi-automatic approach based on crowdsourcing and text mining for extracting a list of soft skills. We find that soft skills are a crucial component of job ads, especially of low-paid jobs and jobs in female-dominated professions. Our work shows that soft skills can serve as partial predictors of the gender composition in job categories and that not all soft skills receive equal wage returns at the labour market. Especially “female” skills are frequently associated with wage penalties. Our results expand the growing literature on the association of soft skills on wage inequality and highlight their importance for occupational gender segregation at labour markets.},

Numerous research efforts have been pushed towards the automatic assessment of personality dimensions relying on a set of information gathered from social media platforms such as list of friends, interests of musics and movies, endorsements and likes an individual has ever performed. Turning this information into signals and giving them as inputs to supervised learning approaches has resulted in being particularly effective and accurate in computing personality traits and types. Despite the demonstrated accuracy of these approaches, the sheer amount of information needed to put in place such a methodology and access restrictions make them unfeasible to be used in a real usage scenario. In this paper, we propose a supervised learning approach to compute personality traits by only relying on what an individual tweets about publicly. The approach segments tweets in tokens, then it learns word vector representations as embeddings that are then used to feed a supervised learner classifier. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by measuring the mean squared error of the learned model using an international benchmark of Facebook status updates. We also test the transfer learning predictive power of this model with an in-house built benchmark created by twenty four panelists who performed a state-of-the-art psychological survey and we observe a good conversion of the model while analyzing their Twitter posts towards the personality traits extracted from the survey.},

Results revealed greater similarity between stereotypes about men and stereotypes about scientists than between stereotypes about women and scientists. Men and scientists were seen as highly agentic, women as highly communal, and scientists as less communal than either men or women. The higher the proportion of women in a scientific field, the more similar the stereotypes of scientists in that field were to stereotypes about women. Female participants perceived more similarity between women and scientists and judged women to be more agentic than male participants did. The results are consistent with role-congruity and lack-of-fit theories that report incompatibility of female gender stereotypes with stereotypes about high-status occupational roles. The results demonstrate that women are perceived to lack the qualities needed to be successful scientists, which may contribute to discrimination and prejudice against female scientists.

In this paper, we propose a new heuristic to train temporal word embeddings based on the Word2vec model. The heuristic consists in using atemporal vectors as a reference, i.e., as a compass, when training the representations specific to a given time interval. The use of the compass simplifies the training process and makes it more efficient. Experiments conducted using state-of-the-art datasets and methodologies suggest that our approach outperforms or equals comparable approaches while being more robust in terms of the required corpus size.},

This holds true after controlling for workers׳ previous labour market status and for changes in the composition of who gets hired over the business cycle. Our evidence suggests that a large part of this reallocation reflect excess churning in the labour market. We also find that the majority of career changes come with wage increases. During the economic expansion wage increases were typically larger for those who change careers than for those who do not. During the recession this is not true for career changers who were hired from unemployment. Our evidence suggests that understanding career changes over the business cycle is important for explaining labour market flows and the cyclicality of wage growth.},

It can also be used in a way that stresses the more practical uses of statistical theory, being more concerned with understanding basic statistical concepts and deriving reasonable statistical procedures for a variety of situations, and less concerned with formal optimality investigations.Important Notice: Media content referenced within the product description or the product text may not be available in the ebook version.},

  abstract = {Model selection strategies for machine learning algorithms typically involve the numerical optimisation of an appropriate model selection criterion, often based on an estimator of generalisation performance, such as k-fold cross-validation. The error of such an estimator can be broken down into bias and variance components. While unbiasedness is often cited as a beneficial quality of a model selection criterion, we demonstrate that a low variance is at least as important, as a nonnegligible variance introduces the potential for over-fitting in model selection as well as in training the model. While this observation is in hindsight perhaps rather obvious, the degradation in performance due to over-fitting the model selection criterion can be surprisingly large, an observation that appears to have received little attention in the machine learning literature to date. In this paper, we show that the effects of this form of over-fitting are often of comparable magnitude to differences in performance between learning algorithms, and thus cannot be ignored in empirical evaluation. Furthermore, we show that some common performance evaluation practices are susceptible to a form of selection bias as a result of this form of over-fitting and hence are unreliable. We discuss methods to avoid over-fitting in model selection and subsequent selection bias in performance evaluation, which we hope will be incorporated into best practice. While this study concentrates on cross-validation based model selection, the findings are quite general and apply to any model selection practice involving the optimisation of a model selection criterion evaluated over a finite sample of data, including maximisation of the Bayesian evidence and optimisation of performance bounds.},

  abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate differences between three generational groups currently in the workforce (Baby Boomers, Generation X, and Generation Y), in work values, job satisfaction, affective organisational commitment and intentions to leave. The study also seeks to examine generational differences in person‐organisation values fit. Design/methodology/approach – A total of 504 Auckland employees representing a range of industries completed an online questionnaire. Generation X (57 per cent) was defined as those born between 1962‐1979, Baby Boomers (23 per cent) were born 1946‐1961 and Generation Y (17 per cent) were born 1980‐2000. The remainder (3 per cent) were born 1925‐1945. Findings – The youngest groups placed more importance on status and freedom work values than the oldest group. Baby Boomers reported better person‐organisation values fit with extrinsic values and status values than Generation X and Generation Y but there were no other generational differences in fit. Where individual and organisational values showed poor fit there were reduced job satisfaction and organisational commitment, and increased intentions to turnover across all three generational groups. Research limitations/implications – The study was cross‐sectional and based on self‐report data, limiting the generalisability of findings. Practical implications – Values are important in guiding behaviour and enhancing work motivation. Organisational values must be able to meet the needs of different employees, and organisations need to clarify their work values and expectations with staff. Originality/value – The paper presents evidence that person‐organisation values fit is important for all generational groups and popular notions about generational differences should not be over‐generalised.},

We review how "talent" is defined in two sets of literature, talent management and migration studies, and find that definitions fall under one of two categories: binary ("talent" as qualities) or composite ("talent" as a relational concept). The implications of our findings are epistemological and ontological; the findings point to diverse epistemological effects of definitions through developments of indicators, as expected, and they also reveal the policy designers' ontological starting points. Ontological perspectives are significant because they ultimately determine whether the policy assessments carried out differ in degrees or in kind. In the case of defining "talent," this means determining which objectives the designers would set (e.g., recruiting vs. cultivating vs. introducing competition), the policy instrumentation for achieving the goals (migration measures vs. education vs. lifelong learning vs. human resource policy), and the type of assessment for measuring policy outcomes (single vs. multiple indicators, qualitative vs. quantitative).

We conclude that the use of HR technologies is in a state of flux with most organizations continuing to use a mix of traditional and technology-based HR methods.

The clearest evidence of resistance to egalitarian pressures emerges in comparing the rate of desegregative change with corresponding rates of change elsewhere in the gender stratification system. It argues that the empirical puzzles have emerged in the literature because stratification scholars tend to treat sex segregation in unidimensional terms and accordingly fail to appreciate that a complex amalgam of processes underlies gender inequality and renders some forms of segregation more entrenched than others. New multidimensional model is useful to begin by asking whether the underlying structure of sex segregation is consistent with unidimensional accounts of segregation. The main arguments is that liberal variants of egalitarianism serve principally to undermine the presumption of male primacy rather than gender essentialism; and, consequently, horizontal forms of segregation may prove to be quite resistant to egalitarianism.},

Across corpora, gender stereotypes emerged consistently and robustly for both theoretically selected stereotypes (e.g., work?home) and comprehensive lists of more than 600 personality traits and more than 300 occupations. Despite underlying differences across language corpora (e.g., time periods, formats, age groups), results revealed the pervasiveness of gender stereotypes in every corpus.

The lag is particularly noticeable in digital gaming and social networking. Theories of technology acceptance and adoption suggest that this lag may be attributable to cost–benefit factors such as perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Other factors that may differentially affect older cohorts are concerns about privacy loss as well as cognitive, perceptual and psychomotor costs. The accelerating digital provision of services may disadvantage non-participating seniors. Those who design ICT products and their training and support packages could benefit from improved theories of ICT adoption and supporting tools to produce usable and useful products for seniors.},

  abstract = {An approach to the construction of classifiers from imbalanced datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the classification categories are not approximately equally represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of "normal" examples with only a small percentage of "abnormal" or "interesting" examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and the ROC convex hull strategy.},

Our review of the literature uncovered 22 high quality academic papers and 122 practitioner-oriented items (e.g., popular press and trade journals). As part of our review, we draw several distinctions between the typical use of HRM algorithms and more traditional statistical applications. We find that while HRM algorithmic applications tend not to be especially theory-driven, the “black box” label often invoked by critics of these efforts is not entirely appropriate. Instead, HRM-related algorithms are best characterized as heuristics. In considering the implications of our findings, we note that there is already evidence of a research-practitioner divide; relative to scholarly efforts, practitioner interest in HRM algorithms has grown exponentially in recent years.},

  abstract = {A prosecutor's decision to charge or dismiss a criminal case is a particularly high-stakes choice. There is concern, however, that these judgements may suffer from explicit or implicit racial bias, as with many other such actions in the criminal justice system. To reduce potential bias in charging decisions, we designed a system that algorithmically redacts race-related information from free-text case narratives. In a first-of-its-kind initiative, we deployed this system at a large American district attorney's office to help prosecutors make race-obscured charging decisions, where it was used to review many incoming felony cases. We report on both the design, efficacy, and impact of our tool for aiding equitable decision-making. We demonstrate that our redaction algorithm is able to accurately obscure race-related information, making it difficult for a human reviewer to guess the race of a suspect while preserving other information from the case narrative. In the jurisdiction we study, we found little evidence of disparate treatment in charging decisions even prior to deployment of our intervention. Thus, as expected, our tool did not substantially alter charging rates. Nevertheless, our study demonstrates the feasibility of race-obscured charging, and more generally highlights the promise of algorithms to bolster equitable decision-making in the criminal justice system.},

Exploring formal and informal sector occupations, the study finds high existence of employers' gender bias in hiring. Explicit gender preferences are highly job specific, and it is common to mention the preferred gender in job ads, which, in general, favor men over women. Although ads for professional occupations exhibit less explicit gender bias, they are not gender neutral. In all types of professional jobs, irrespective of the share of ads with preference for men or women, on average, ads targeting men specify/offer much higher salary. Employers in elementary sectors as well as blue-collar jobs express more segregated gender preference. The findings support the existing research that argues women are more preferred in low-quality, low-status, typically low-paid informal jobs. Targeting women for low-quality jobs explains half of the mean offered salary gap specified in ads; the rest is direct gender bias. The paper also suggests that, with the rise of new technology and sectors, gender bias in hiring in those new types of jobs is expected to decline.},

A long line of literature has established partisan stereotypes of politicians, but we know less about the source of these stereotypes and whether they apply to partisans in the mass public. Building on moral psychology, I argue that the public holds clear stereotypes about the moral character of mass partisans and that these stereotypes are rooted in ideology. Using a national survey, I show that Democrats and Republicans prioritize different aspects of moral character, but that these differences are more strongly linked to political ideology than partisan identity. Next, I show that much of the public holds trait stereotypes about mass partisans that reflect these differences in trait importance. Finally, I provide experimental evidence that people use partisan cues to draw stereotypical inferences about individuals, but that these inferences are more responsive to ideological information than partisan cues. Overall, the results suggest that partisan stereotypes are not merely outgroup animus, but reflect the values and motivations that differentiate the parties.},

The results show that socialization tactics influence perceived fit, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment, but not actual fit. As hypothesized, perceived and actual fit become more congruent over time, suggesting a shift in newcomers' perceptions of the organization. Additional analyses were conducted to investigate the mediating influence of perceived fit on the relationship of investiture with job satisfaction and with organizational commitment and, for both outcomes, this was found to be significant. We discuss the implications for organization socialization procedures, research into newcomer entry using measures of actual and perceived fit, and HRM practices during the initial few months of organizational entry.},

While cohort replacement can explain about half of the increasing egalitarianism between 1974 and 1994, the changes since the mid-1990s are not well accounted for by cohort differences. Nor is the post-1994 stagnation explained by structural or broad ideological changes in American society. The recent lack of change in gender attitudes is more likely the consequence of the rise of a new cultural frame, an “egalitarian essentialism” that blends aspects of feminist equality and traditional motherhood roles.},

  abstract = {Recognizing that "managing" diversity has become a critical skill in organizations all over the world, Developing Competency to Manage Diversity shows how the dynamics of diversity affect people on all levels of society and in all kinds of organizations-from individual relationships to community interactions, from city and national governments to work teams and product markets. Defining diversity as "a mix of people in one social system who have distinctly different, socially relevant, group identities," this volume responds to the increasing need to function effectively in workplace contexts that are culturally, socially, economically, and racially diverse. To this end, it provides managers with tools they need to successfully manage a diverse workforce. Chapters provide specific tasks and activities to- o Increase awareness of coworkers' cultural backgrounds o Create a "pro-diversity" organizational climate o Develop an operational definition of diversity o Explore how group identity applies to each group member o Investigate differences of cognitive style o Customize team-building strategies for diverse groups Organized in an easy-to-follow, step-by-step format, a set of twenty-three readings, six case studies, and thirty-one activities takes readers through a three-stage learning process. The first stage creates awareness of a diversity-related issue, the second stage develops knowledge and understanding of effective ways to handle that issue, and the final stage outlines practical actions to respond to the issue. The high costs of failing to recognize and manage diversity-absenteeism, dissatisfaction, barriers to contribution, harassment, discrimination suits, reduced efficiency, and lack of communication-as well as the potential to leverage diversity as an organizational resource-should motivate organizations and groups to make full use of Developing Competency to Manage Diversity.},

Data from six non-U.S. countries, including three collectivist cultures, demonstrate elderly stereotypes are consistent across varied cultures. Second, we investigate the persistence of the evaluatively -mixed nature of the elderly stereotype. In an experiment, 55 college students rated less competent elderly targets (stereotype-consistent) as warmer than more competent (stereotype-inconsistent) and control elderly targets. We also discuss the type of discrimination—social exclusion—that elderly people often endure.},

From these intergroup emotions and stereotypes, the behavior from intergroup affect and stereotypes (BIAS) map predicts distinct behaviors: active and passive, facilitative and harmful. After defining warmth/communion and competence/agency, the chapter integrates converging work documenting the centrality of these dimensions in interpersonal as well as intergroup perception. Structural origins of warmth and competence perceptions result from competitors judged as not warm, and allies judged as warm; high status confers competence and low status incompetence. Warmth and competence judgments support systematic patterns of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral reactions, including ambivalent prejudices. Past views of prejudice as a univalent antipathy have obscured the unique responses toward groups stereotyped as competent but not warm or warm but not competent.

Here, the SCM reveals theoretically grounded, cross-cultural, cross-groups similarities and one difference across 10 non-US nations. Seven European (individualist) and three East Asian (collectivist) nations (N=1,028) support three hypothesized cross-cultural similarities: (a) perceived warmth and competence reliably differentiate societal group stereotypes; (b) many out-groups receive ambivalent stereotypes (high on one dimension; low on the other); and (c) high status groups stereotypically are competent, whereas competitive groups stereotypically lack warmth. Data uncover one consequential cross-cultural difference: (d) the more collectivist cultures do not locate reference groups (in-groups and societal prototype groups) in the most positive cluster (high-competence/high-warmth), unlike individualist cultures. This demonstrates out-group derogation without obvious reference-group favouritism. The SCM can serve as a pancultural tool for predicting group stereotypes from structural relations with other groups in society, and comparing across societies.},

  abstract = {Various levels of automation can be introduced by intelligent decision support systems, from fully automated, where the operator is completely left out of the decision process, to minimal levels of automation, where the automation only makes recommendations and the operator has the final say. For rigid tasks that require no flexibility in decision-making and with a low probability of system failure, higher levels of automation often provide the best solution. However, in time critical environments with many external and changing constraints such as air traffic control and military command and control operations, higher levels of automation are not advisable because of the risks and the complexity of both the system and the inability of the automated decision aid to be perfectly reliable. Human-in-the-loop designs, which employ automation for redundant, manual, and monotonous tasks and allow operators active participation, provide not only safety benefits, but also allow a human operator and a system to respond more flexibly to uncertain and unexpected events. However, there can be measurable costs to human performance when automation is used, such as loss of situational awareness, complacency, skill degradation, and automation bias. This paper will discuss the influence of automation bias in intelligent decision support systems, particularly those in aviation domains. Automation bias occurs in decision-making because humans have a tendency to disregard or not search for contradictory information in light of a computer-generated solution that is accepted as correct and can be exacerbated in time critical domains. Automated decision aids are designed to reduce human error but actually can cause new errors in the operation of a system if not designed with human cognitive limitations in mind.},

  abstract = {Text Classification pipelines are a sequence of tasks needed to be performed to classify documents into a set of predefined categories. The pre-processing phase (before training) of these pipelines involve different ways of transforming and manipulating the documents for the next (learning) phase. In this paper, we introduce three new steps into the pre-processing phase of text classification pipelines to improve effectiveness while reducing the associated costs. The distance-based Meta-Features (MFs) generation step aims at reducing the dimensionality of the original term-document matrix while producing a potentially more informative space that explicitly exploits discriminative labeled information. The second step is a sparsification one aimed at making the MF representation less dense to reduce training costs and noise. The third step is a selective sampling (SS) aimed at removing lines (documents) of the matrix obtained in the previous step, by carefully selecting the “best” documents for the learning phase. Our experiments show that the proposed extended pre-processing pipeline can achieve significant gains in effectiveness when compared to the original TF-IDF (up to 52\%) and embedding-based representations (up to 46\%), at a much lower cost (up to 9.7x faster in some datasets). Other main contributions of our work include a thorough and rigorous evaluation of the trade-offs between cost and effectiveness associated with the introduction of these new steps into the pipeline as well as a comprehensive comparative experimental evaluation of many alternatives in terms of representations, approaches, etc.},

  abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this study is to test the relationships of learning, organizational commitment and talent retention across managerial generations in Europe. Design/methodology/approach – Hypotheses are developed to explain the influence of learning and organizational commitment on talent retention across generations. A total of 1,666 European managers completed a survey on these issues. Depending on year of birth, they were categorized into four generational cohorts. Their answers were analyzed with statistic procedures. Findings – Findings reveal that younger generations are less willing to remain in the same organization and have lower organizational commitment. The youngest generations (Early and Late Xers, born 1960 and after) show stronger learning orientation and lower organizational commitment than older generations (Early and Late Boomers, born 1946‐1959). Learning orientation predicted the intention to remain in the same organization for Early Xers and Late Xers. Organizational commitment mediated this relationship. For Late Boomers and Early Xers, it mediated the relationship between specific leadership development intentions and intention to stay. Research limitations/implications – Managerial, job‐related learning is confirmed as an important antecedent for the intention to stay/leave one's current organization. The differential meaning of learning and commitment across generations needs to be better understood in order to develop effective strategies for the retention of talent in all generations. In particular, differences in the psychological contract between organizations and their managers need to be understood. Practical implications – The findings suggest an approach of generation‐specific HR practices for talent retention. Originality/value – The study is one of the first to date to address leadership development and learning orientation in the context of talent retention, as well as one of the first to address the discussion of generational challenges in Europe and across the specific population of people in managerial roles.},

  abstract = {Talent management (TM) has gotten more and more attention recently, but definitions/approaches to talented employees still confusingly differ. Therefore, talent definitions were collected from selected peer-reviewed TM articles, and corporate talent conceptualizations were examined through empirical data. For the systematic literature review, we examined 507 English-only publications published until the end of 2018 in the Web of Science database containing “talent management” in the topic field. Empirical data was collected from Hungarian corporations; the answers (n = 67) to the relevant questions of the online questionnaire were also analyzed. The results show that there are still TM articles without any kind of conceptualization of “talent,” while in other cases different talent tensions/approaches and further inconsistencies are observable. Such tensions/approaches are, for example, the object versus subject ones. All of them can be explicitly or implicitly connected to competencies; thus, they can also become measurable via measuring competencies. This paper offers a comprehensive and consistent solution by suggesting the application of a well-known competency model in the TM context. This proposed competency-based approach can become such a first step of any comprehensive corporate TM initiative that would serve and synchronize all the further ones—substantially contributing to the overall success of HRM.},

We present AdFisher, an automated tool that explores how user behaviors, Google's ads, and Ad Settings interact. AdFisher can run browser-based experiments and analyze data using machine learning and significance tests. Our tool uses a rigorous experimental design and statistical analysis to ensure the statistical soundness of our results. We use AdFisher to find that the Ad Settings was opaque about some features of a user's profile, that it does provide some choice on ads, and that these choices can lead to seemingly discriminatory ads. In particular, we found that visiting webpages associated with substance abuse changed the ads shown but not the settings page. We also found that setting the gender to female resulted in getting fewer instances of an ad related to high paying jobs than setting it to male. We cannot determine who caused these findings due to our limited visibility into the ad ecosystem, which includes Google, advertisers, websites, and users. Nevertheless, these results can form the starting point for deeper investigations by either the companies themselves or by regulatory bodies.},

Existing work has shown that non-linguistic biases in models can drive model behavior away from linguistic generalizations. We hypothesized that competing linguistic processes within a language, rather than just non-linguistic model biases, could obscure underlying linguistic knowledge. We tested this claim by exploring a single phenomenon in four languages: English, Chinese, Spanish, and Italian. While human behavior has been found to be similar across languages, we find cross-linguistic variation in model behavior. We show that competing processes in a language act as constraints on model behavior and demonstrate that targeted fine-tuning can re-weight the learned constraints, uncovering otherwise dormant linguistic knowledge in models. Our results suggest that models need to learn both the linguistic constraints in a language and their relative ranking, with mismatches in either producing non-human-like behavior.},

Most subjective measures used in practice are unvalidated, and their relationship to system usage is unknown. The present research develops and validates new scales for two specific variables, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, which are hypothesized to be fundamental determinants of user acceptance. Definitions for these two variables were used to develop scale items that were pretested for content validity and then tested for reliability and construct validity in two studies involving a total of 152 users and four application programs. The measures were refined and stream-lined, resulting in two six-item scales with reliabilities of.98 for usefulness and.94 for ease of use. The scales exhibited high convergent, discriminant, and factorial validity. Perceived usefulness was significantly correlated with both self-reported current usage (r=.63, Study 1) and self-predicted future usage (r=.85, Study 2). Perceived ease of use was also significantly correlated with current usage (r=.45, Study 1) and future usage (r=.59, Study 2). In both studies, usefulness had a significantly greater correlation with usage behavior than did ease of use. Regression analyses suggest that perceived ease of use may actually be a causal antecedent to perceived usefulness, as opposed to a parallel, direct determinant of system usage. Implications are drawn for future research on user acceptance.},

  abstract = {Computer systems cannot improve organizational performance if they aren't used. Unfortunately, resistance to end-user systems by managers and professionals is a widespread problem. To better predict, explain, and increase user acceptance, we need to better understand why people accept or reject computers. This research addresses the ability to predict peoples' computer acceptance from a measure of their intentions, and the ability to explain their intentions in terms of their attitudes, subjective norms, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and related variables. In a longitudinal study of 107 users, intentions to use a specific system, measured after a one-hour introduction to the system, were correlated 0.35 with system use 14 weeks later. The intention-usage correlation was 0.63 at the end of this time period. Perceived usefulness strongly influenced peoples' intentions, explaining more than half of the variance in intentions at the end of 14 weeks. Perceived ease of use had a small but significant effect on intentions as well, although this effect subsided over time. Attitudes only partially mediated the effects of these beliefs on intentions. Subjective norms had no effect on intentions. These results suggest the possibility of simple but powerful models of the determinants of user acceptance, with practical value for evaluating systems and guiding managerial interventions aimed at reducing the problem of underutilized computer technology.},

In contrast, the impact of enjoyment on usage intentions has not been examined. Two studies are reported concerning the relative effects of usefulness and enjoyment on intentions to use, and usage of, computers in the workplace. Usefulness had a strong effect on usage intentions in both Study 1, regarding word processing software (β=.68), and Study 2, regarding business graphics programs (β=.79). As hypothesized, enjoyment also had a significant effect on intentions in both studies, controlling for perceived usefulness (β=.16 and 0.15 for Studies 1 and 2, respectively). Study 1 found that intentions correlated 0.63 with system usage and that usefulness and enjoyment influenced usage behavior entirely indirectly through their effects on intentions. In both studies, a positive interaction between usefulness and enjoyment was observed. Together, usefulness and enjoyment explained 62\% (Study 1) and 75\% (Study 2) of the variance in usage intentions. Moreover, usefulness and enjoyment were found to mediate fully the effects on usage intentions of perceived output quality and perceived ease of use. As hypothesized, a measure of task importance moderated the effects of ease of use and output quality on usefulness but not on enjoyment. Several implications are drawn for how to design computer programs to be both more useful and more enjoyable in order to increase their acceptability among potential users.},

However, when dealing with highly skewed datasets, Precision-Recall (PR) curves give a more informative picture of an algorithm's performance. We show that a deep connection exists between ROC space and PR space, such that a curve dominates in ROC space if and only if it dominates in PR space. A corollary is the notion of an achievable PR curve, which has properties much like the convex hull in ROC space; we show an efficient algorithm for computing this curve. Finally, we also note differences in the two types of curves are significant for algorithm design. For example, in PR space it is incorrect to linearly interpolate between points. Furthermore, algorithms that optimize the area under the ROC curve are not guaranteed to optimize the area under the PR curve.},

  abstract = {Citizens encounter many street-level bureaucrats in their lifetime. How do they assess the traits of the bureaucrats they meet? Understanding citizens’ assessments of bureaucrats is important, because citizens are not passive receivers of policies. This article explores citizens’ classifications of street-level bureaucrats based on their core task. Using a factorial survey (n~=~580), three clusters of bureaucrats are identified: those who are regulation oriented, those who are service oriented, and those who are both regulation and service oriented. Then, the article tests how these three types of bureaucrats are assessed on warmth and competence and whether their gender matters. A between-subjects experiment (n~=~1,602) reveals that regulation-oriented bureaucrats are assessed as least competent and warm. Moreover, regardless of core task, female bureaucrats are assessed as warmer than males. Female and male bureaucrats are assessed as equally competent. This article shows that bureaucrats are stereotyped by citizens and discusses the implications for the public management literature. Evidence for Practice: While researchers and practitioners tend to focus on commonalities between street-level bureaucrats, focusing on differences—for instance, in terms of core task and gender—may be helpful to understand how citizens see and react to their encounters with bureaucrats. Much like street-level bureaucrats’ stereotypical notions of citizens, citizens stereotype the bureaucrats they encounter. These stereotypes are based on cues related to the bureaucrats’ core task and gender. Especially for regulation-oriented organizations and street-level bureaucrats, such as inspectorates, being aware of stereotypes may be useful when engaging with citizens because they are rated as the least competent and warm.},

  abstract = {In a country with an ageing work-force, a decline in the number of new entrants to the labour market and an acute labour shortage, it would be reasonable to assume that employers would encourage older workers to remain in employment for as long as possible. In the case of Singapore, however, private sector employers often retired employees at age 55 and hired younger workers in their place. In many cases older workers re-hired had to accept lower pay and lower grade jobs. In an attempt to tackle this sort of age discrimination in employment, the government passed the Retirement Age Act in 1993. Prior to its enactment, the government urged employers to raise the retirement age voluntarily, but the response was poor, especially in the non-unionized sector. This paper argues that employers resisted the extension of the retirement age because they perceived older workers in stereotypical terms. The main issues which gave rise to the Retirement Age legislation are discussed. So also is the possible impact of the legislation on some HRM practices. The paper also proposes some future directions for research on older workers in Singapore.},

  abstract = {Purpose – This paper aims to use the signaling theory and the person‐organization fit framework as a rationale to study value‐related information prospective applicants receive from employers through the communication in job ads. Design/methodology/approach – The authors analyzed the content of 1,768 job advertisements published in two national and two regional Dutch‐speaking magazines in Belgium. Four independent judges coded all information in the offer section and categorized it into five content categories adopted from Lyons and colleagues. Since important sectoral distinctions exist in terms of structural‐operational as well as value‐related characteristics, this study examines how profit and nonprofit organizations portray themselves in the offer section of the job advertisements they send out. Findings – Generally inconsistent with the authors' assumptions, the results show that intrinsic and prestige values are more intensively reported in job ads from the profit sector, whereas altruistic and extrinsic values are brought up more in job ads from the nonprofit sector. However, because nonprofit organizations print smaller, often non‐colored ads in the national language, additional analyses controlling for these factors confirmed only one of the sectoral differences. Nonprofit organizations seem to compensate for values that are obvious in their sector (i.e. altruistic and intrinsic) by more intensively emphasizing extrinsic values (e.g. insurance and fringe benefits) compared to profit organizations. Originality/value – Only part of the information provided in the earliest phase of the recruitment process reflects the values one would expect based on organizational theory and empirical evidence. This, obviously, engenders an important threat to the establishment of person‐organization fit.},

One of the most prominent pre-trained language models is BERT, which was released as an English as well as a multilingual version. Although multilingual BERT performs well on many tasks, recent studies show that BERT models trained on a single language significantly outperform the multilingual version. Training a Dutch BERT model thus has a lot of potential for a wide range of Dutch NLP tasks. While previous approaches have used earlier implementations of BERT to train a Dutch version of BERT, we used RoBERTa, a robustly optimized BERT approach, to train a Dutch language model called RobBERT. We measured its performance on various tasks as well as the importance of the fine-tuning dataset size. We also evaluated the importance of language-specific tokenizers and the model’s fairness. We found that RobBERT improves state-of-the-art results for various tasks, and especially significantly outperforms other models when dealing with smaller datasets. These results indicate that it is a powerful pre-trained model for a large variety of Dutch language tasks. The pre-trained and fine-tuned models are publicly available to support further downstream Dutch NLP applications.},

Using detailed occupational data, this study analyses the size and causes of this occupational gender wage-gap in the Dutch labour market using multi-level modelling techniques. The analyses show that both men and women earn lower wages if they are employed in female-dominated occupations. This especially indicates the significance of gender in Western labour markets, since overall levels of wage inequality are relatively small in the Netherlands compared to, for example, the United Kingdom and the United States. Differences in required responsibility are particularly important in accounting for this occupational wage-gap. Nonetheless, we find large wage penalties for working in a female-dominated instead of a male-dominated occupation for occupations that require high levels of education, skills, and responsibility.},

As some of the most valid selection instruments display large ethnic performance differences, scientists attempt to develop strategies that reduce ethnic subgroup differences in selection performance, while simultaneously maintaining criterion-related validity. This paper provides an evidence-based overview of the effectiveness of six strategies for dealing with the diversity-validity dilemma: (1) using ‘alternative’ cognitive ability measures, (2) employing simulations, (3) using statistical approaches to combine predictor and criterion measures, (4) reducing criterion-irrelevant predictor variance, (5) fostering positive candidate reactions, and (6) providing coaching and opportunity for practice to candidates. Three of these strategies (i.e., employing simulation-based assessments, developing alternative cognitive ability measures, and using statistical procedures) are identified as holding the most promise to alleviate the dilemma. Potential areas in need for future research are discussed.},

  abstract = {Addressing the underrepresentation of women in science is a top priority for many institutions, but the majority of efforts to increase representation of women are neither evidence-based nor rigorously assessed. One exception is the gender bias habit-breaking intervention (Carnes et al., 2015), which, in a cluster-randomized trial involving all but two departmental clusters (N=92) in the 6 STEMM focused schools/colleges at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, led to increases in gender bias awareness and self-efficacy to promote gender equity in academic science departments and perceptions of a more positive departmental climate. Following this initial success, the present study compares, in a preregistered analysis, hiring rates of new female faculty pre- and post-manipulation. Whereas the proportion of women hired by control departments remained stable over time, the proportion of women hired by intervention departments increased by an estimated 18 percentage points (OR=2.23, dOR=0.34). Though the preregistered analysis did not achieve conventional levels of statistical significance (p{$<$}0.07), the study has a hard upper limit on statistical power, as the cluster-randomized trial has a maximum sample size of 92 departmental clusters. These findings, however, have undeniable practical significance for the advancement of women in science, and provide promising evidence that psychological interventions can facilitate gender equity and diversity.},

As a result, we propose an agenda for adopting open science practices in Communication, which includes the following seven suggestions: (1) publish materials, data, and code; (2) preregister studies and submit registered reports; (3) conduct replications; (4) collaborate; (5) foster open science skills; (6) implement Transparency and Openness Promotion Guidelines; and (7) incentivize open science practices. Although in our agenda we focus mostly on quantitative research, we also reflect on open science practices relevant to qualitative research.

Design/methodology/approach – A total of 34 interviews were conducted within three study samples: high potentials (n=14), organisational representatives employed by the same organisations that provided the high‐potential participants (n=8), and organisational representatives employed by organisations that did not allow for interviewing of their high potentials (n=12). Findings – The current study suggests that high potentials still have organisational‐traditional careers. High upward mobility, low inter‐organisational mobility and career self‐management emerged as key features of real high‐potential careers. Practical implications – Implications are spelled out with respect to the “streaming” of different types of employees in the workforce and the importance of expectations management. Originality/value – Not only are the viewpoints of individuals largely absent in the literature on high‐potential careers, the majority of publications on the subject‐matter are also non‐empirical and take a rather normative stance. The interview study presented in this paper looks into the assumptions of real high‐potential careers from the perspectives of the high potentials themselves as well as those of their organizations, providing empirical data that are interpretive and descriptive rather than normative.},

  abstract = {In this chapter we aim to advance understanding of the meanings attributed to ‘talent’ by HR directors across the world (N = 410), and how their ‘talent mindsets’ translate into the ways in which talent is identified and managed in their organizations. Respondents from different cultural clusters mentioned ability, skills, knowledge, and potential as high-ranking associations with talent. In addition, the HR directors seemed to agree that talent can be developed for over 50 \%. We did find cultural differences relating to the extent to which organizations had an ‘inclusive’ talent management mindset, and the extent to which they relied on first impressions in their assessments of talent. In both cases, organizations from the Anglo cluster scored higher than the other clusters. This is particularly interesting in that the talent management literature is somewhat Anglo-Saxon biased (as most literature is produced in the US and the UK)—further research is necessary to examine the extent to which Anglo-Saxon approaches to talent management can be generalized (or ‘exported’) to other countries and cultures, especially within one and the same MNC. Specific implications for global talent management research and practice are spelled out.},

  abstract = {Social scientists have documented framing effects in a wide range of contexts, including surveys, experiments, and actual political campaigns. Many view work on framing effects as evidence of citizen incompetence—that is, evidence that citizens base their preferences on arbitrary information and/or are subject to extensive elite manipulation. Yet, we continue to lack a consensus on what a framing effect is as well as an understanding of how and when framing effects occur. In this article, I examine (1) the different ways that scholars have employed the concepts of framing and framing effects, (2) how framing effects may violate some basic criteria of citizen competence, and (3) what we know about how and when framing effects work. I conclude that while the evidence to date suggests some isolated cases of incompetence, the more general message is that citizens use frames in a competent and well-reasoned manner.},

Admiration prejudice depicted ingroups; envious and contemptuous prejudices depicted specific outgroups, generally in line with SCM predictions. No paternalistic prejudice appeared; historical reasons might explain this finding. Results also fit the recently developed BIAS Map of behavioral consequences. In Study 2, ninety-six undergraduates rated the content-analysis traits on warmth and competence, without knowing their origin. They corroborated SCM's interpretations of the archival data.

One consequence is that attitudes are less positive toward female than male leaders and potential leaders. Other consequences are that it is more difficult for women to become leaders and to achieve success in leadership roles.

The review encompasses P–E fit theories that span nearly a century and cover research on job satisfaction, job stress, vocational choice, recruitment and selection, and organizational climate and culture. This review indicates that most theories in P–E fit research fall well short of criteria for developing strong theory, and theories presented in recent years are no stronger than those developed decades earlier. Reasons for theoretical stagnation in P–E fit research are identified, and ways to promote theoretical progress are discussed.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to point out the importance of technology trust and relationships between technology trust and trust antecedents. The paper aims to seek answers to the following questions: what determines technology trust (technology trust antecedents) and how to measure it in the case of the University Student Service System (USSS) technology? Design/methodology/approach In this study, the survey method was used to collect data. The online survey engaged 413 students representing one Polish technical university. The USSS was the technology of interest. The USSS web is an IT system for managing the course of higher education. The USSS web evolved into a multipurpose platform, which is used by university students for many different purposes. Findings Positive verification of three accepted hypotheses H1, H3 and H5 shows that the ease of use, general trust level of respondents and institutional trust have a statistically significant influence on USSS technology trust. The diversification of regression coefficients indicates that the ease of use determines USSS technology trust more than general trust and institutional trust. Research limitations/implications An important limitation of the conducted study was the reduction of the sample group of students representing one university – the Bialystok University of Technology. The relationships between variables, however, have made it possible to explain the reasons for the existing dependencies from the perspective of a single university, which constitutes an important cognitive value in the context of motivating and disseminating information and communication technology solutions. A good adjustment of the developed theoretical model indicates that it can be used to a wider degree. Practical implications From the practical point of view, achieved results showed that there are many factors that can be influenced by managers within an organisation to build up technology trust relations. Institutional trust is one example of such factors. Also, considering that building trust is a process, managers should take into account that different factors can affect technology trust in different stages of this process. At the beginning phase, the ease of use of a particular technology seems to be most important for its users, and then the usefulness of the technology becomes the factor which determines the technology trust. Despite the fact that the conducted research did not show statistically significant relations between technology trust and the intention of future system use, results explained main factors affecting such situations. Also, the frequency of system use seemed to be the most important variable that determines the intention of future system use. Originality/value The scientific value of the study is an attempt to build a measurement scales relating to trust in technology and constructs determining that trust. According to a very popular technology acceptance model, which explains the behaviour of technology users, the author expanded the acceptance model and finally proposed the model consisting of five input variables (the ease of use, usefulness, institutional trust, general trust, trust in technology and science) and one output variable – the intention to use the system in the future. The novelty of the research results from the fact that it was the first research conducted in Poland on the topic of technology trust topic.},

We identify four mechanisms involved in hiring that add to the “strategicness” of human capital decisions. We posit that, to the degree that human capital outcomes are influenced by these mechanisms, hiring cannot be effectively delegated or treated independently from a firm’s other strategic decisions, nor will a “best athlete” approach to hiring lead to optimal results. We outline the shifts in scholarly attention required for scholars to conceptualize hiring as a strategic process, and we argue that this conceptualization is critical given the increasing use of data science tools by industry to support and automate hiring decisions. By delving into the mechanisms and conditions that make hiring strategic, we contribute to a broader understanding of how and why firms acquire human capital and highlight gaps and opportunities for future research.},

Much prior research has examined whether this variation could be due to variation in gender equality in opportunities, with mixed results. Here we focus instead on the role of a society’s values about gender equality, which may have a more pervasive influence. We pooled all available country measures on adolescent boys’ and girls’ academic achievement between 2000 and 2015 from the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) and Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) assessments of math, science, and reading. We then analyzed the relation between gender differences and country levels of gender egalitarian values, controlling for country levels of living standards and indicators of gender equality in opportunities. Gender egalitarian values came out as the most important predictor. Specifically, more gender egalitarian values were associated with improved performance of boys relative to girls in the same countries. This pattern held in reading, where boys globally perform substantially worse than girls, as well as in math and science where gender differences in performance are small and may favor either boys or girls. Our findings suggest a previously underappreciated role of cultural values in moderating gender gaps in academic achievement.},

We focus on a particular area of the “Looking at People” (LAP) thematic domain: first impressions and personality analysis. Our aim is to make the computational intelligence and computer vision communities aware of the importance of developing explanatory mechanisms for computer-assisted decision making applications, such as automating recruitment. Judgments based on personality traits are being made routinely by human resource departments to evaluate the candidates' capacity of social insertion and their potential of career growth. However, inferring personality traits and, in general, the process by which we humans form a first impression of people, is highly subjective and may be biased. Previous studies have demonstrated that learning machines can learn to mimic human decisions. In this paper, we go one step further and formulate the problem of explaining the decisions of the models as a means of identifying what visual aspects are important, understanding how they relate to decisions suggested, and possibly gaining insight into undesirable negative biases. We design a new challenge on explainability of learning machines for first impressions analysis. We describe the setting, scenario, evaluation metrics and preliminary outcomes of the competition. To the best of our knowledge this is the first effort in terms of challenges for explainability in computer vision. In addition our challenge design comprises several other quantitative and qualitative elements of novelty, including a “coopetition” setting, which combines competition and collaboration.},

As such, using an ethical lens to study this phenomenon is to better understand whether and how AI matters in hiring. In this paper, we examine whether ethical perceptions of using AI in the hiring process influence individuals’ trust in the organizations that use it. Building on the organizational trust model and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, we explore whether ethical perceptions are shaped by individual differences in performance expectancy and social influence and how they, in turn, impact organizational trust. We collected primary data from over 300 individuals who were either active job seekers or who had recent hiring experience to capture perceptions across the full range of hiring methods. Our findings indicate that performance expectancy, but not social influence, impacts the ethical perceptions of AI in hiring, which in turn influence organizational trust. Additional analyses indicate that these findings vary depending on the type of hiring methods AI is used for, as well as on whether participants are job seekers or individuals with hiring experience. Our study offers theoretical and practical implications for ethics in HRM and informs policy implementation about when and how to use AI in hiring methods, especially as it pertains to acting ethically and trustworthily.},

  abstract = {Background: Supervised learning methods need annotated data in order to generate efficient models. Annotated data, however, is a relatively scarce resource and can be expensive to obtain. For both passive and active learning methods, there is a need to estimate the size of the annotated sample required to reach a performance target. Methods: We designed and implemented a method that fits an inverse power law model to points of a given learning curve created using a small annotated training set. Fitting is carried out using nonlinear weighted least squares optimization. The fitted model is then used to predict the classifier’s performance and confidence interval for larger sample sizes. For evaluation, the nonlinear weighted curve fitting method was applied to a set of learning curves generated using clinical text and waveform classification tasks with active and passive sampling methods, and predictions were validated using standard goodness of fit measures. As control we used an unweighted fitting method. Results: A total of 568 models were fitted and the model predictions were compared with the observed performances. Depending on the data set and sampling method, it took between 80 to 560 annotated samples to achieve mean average and root mean squared error below 0.01. Results also show that our weighted fitting method outperformed the baseline un-weighted method (p {$<$} 0.05). Conclusions: This paper describes a simple and effective sample size prediction algorithm that conducts weighted fitting of learning curves. The algorithm outperformed an un-weighted algorithm described in previous literature. It can help researchers determine annotation sample size for supervised machine learning.},

This review indicates that the sexes are neither distinctly different, nor so similar as to be fungible. Justice-based gains of workplace gender diversity include that it may cause less sex discrimination and may combat androcentrism in products and services. We then consider potential instrumental benefits of workplace gender diversity to organizations, including for team and firm performance, innovation, occupational well-being, and corporate governance. The evidence of positive association is currently strongest for occupational well-being and governance. We recommend that policy makers ground gender diversity initiatives in this comprehensive and evidence-based understanding of the benefits of workplace gender diversity.},

  abstract = {Decision-making systems increasingly orchestrate our world: how to intervene on the algorithmic components to build fair and equitable systems is therefore a question of utmost importance; one that is substantially complicated by the context-dependent nature of fairness and discrimination. Modern decision-making systems that involve allocating resources or information to people (e.g., school choice, advertising) incorporate machine-learned predictions in their pipelines, raising concerns about potential strategic behavior or constrained allocation, concerns usually tackled in the context of mechanism design. Although both machine learning and mechanism design have developed frameworks for addressing issues of fairness and equity, in some complex decision-making systems, neither framework is individually sufficient. In this paper, we develop the position that building fair decision-making systems requires overcoming these limitations which, we argue, are inherent to each field. Our ultimate objective is to build an encompassing framework that cohesively bridges the individual frameworks of mechanism design and machine learning. We begin to lay the ground work towards this goal by comparing the perspective each discipline takes on fair decision-making, teasing out the lessons each field has taught and can teach the other, and highlighting application domains that require a strong collaboration between these disciplines.},

  abstract = {[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported online in Journal of Personality and Social Psychology on Apr 18 2019 (see record 2019-21976-001). In the fourth paragraph of the Status Predicts Competence, and Competition Predicts Warmth section, the results are worded in a confusing way, and some values are wrong. In the fourth paragraph’s first sentence, all correlation coefficients mistakenly omitted the negative sign implied in the text (“negatively correlated”) and shown in the correct values reported in Table 6. The text should appear instead as follows: Perceived competition negatively correlated with perceived warmth for the student sample, group-level r(21) .68, p r(71) .22, p r(21) .53, p r(36) .11, ns.] Stereotype research emphasizes systematic processes over seemingly arbitrary contents, but content also may prove systematic. On the basis of stereotypes' intergroup functions, the stereotype content model hypothesizes that (1) 2 primary dimensions are competence and warmth, (2) frequent mixed clusters combine high warmth with low competence (paternalistic) or high competence with low warmth (envious), and (3) distinct emotions (pity, envy, admiration, contempt) differentiate the 4 competence-warmth combinations. Stereotypically, (4) status predicts high competence, and competition predicts low warmth. Nine varied samples rated gender, ethnicity, race, class, age, and disability out-groups. Contrary to antipathy models, 2 dimensions mattered, and many stereotypes were mixed, either pitying (low competence, high warmth subordinates) or envying (high competence, low warmth competitors). Stereotypically, status predicted competence, and competition predicted low warmth. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

The stereotype content model (SCM) terms these two basic dimensions perceived warmth (trustworthiness, friendliness) and competence (capability, assertiveness).

Generality across place, levels, and time further support the framework. Similar dimensions have emerged repeatedly over the history of psychology and in current theories. The SCM proposes and tests a comprehensive causal theory: Perceived social structure (cooperation, status) predicts stereotypes (warmth, competence), which in turn predict emotional prejudices (pride, pity, contempt, envy), and finally, the emotions predict discrimination (active and passive help and harm). The SCM uncovers systematic content and dynamics of stereotypes, which has practical implications.},

  abstract = {Recently there has been a growing concern that many published research findings do not hold up in attempts to replicate them. We argue that this problem may originate from a culture of ‘you can publish if you found a significant effect’. This culture creates a systematic bias against the null hypothesis which renders meta-analyses questionable and may even lead to a situation where hypotheses become difficult to falsify. In order to pinpoint the sources of error and possible solutions, we review current scientific practices with regard to their effect on the probability of drawing a false-positive conclusion. We explain why the proportion of published false-positive findings is expected to increase with (i) decreasing sample size, (ii) increasing pursuit of novelty, (iii) various forms of multiple testing and researcher flexibility, and (iv) incorrect P-values, especially due to unaccounted pseudoreplication, i.e. the non-independence of data points (clustered data). We provide examples showing how statistical pitfalls and psychological traps lead to conclusions that are biased and unreliable, and we show how these mistakes can be avoided. Ultimately, we hope to contribute to a culture of ‘you can publish if your study is rigorous’. To this end, we highlight promising strategies towards making science more objective. Specifically, we enthusiastically encourage scientists to preregister their studies (including a priori hypotheses and complete analysis plans), to blind observers to treatment groups during data collection and analysis, and unconditionally to report all results. Also, we advocate reallocating some efforts away from seeking novelty and discovery and towards replicating important research findings of one’s own and of others for the benefit of the scientific community as a whole. We believe these efforts will be aided by a shift in evaluation criteria away from the current system which values metrics of ‘impact’ almost exclusively and towards a system which explicitly values indices of scientific rigour.},

The authors therefore analyse gender-(un)typed horizontal occupational transitions and their influence on the vertical positioning, based on the Austrian Micro Census (2008–2018). The results reveal that gender-typed occupational transitions are regaining relevance and that the gender effect is reversing in that women increasingly leave gender-untyped occupations. The findings also demonstrate that this gender-typed horizontal movement yields a significant decline in occupational status for women, which even increases when women become mothers. Based on their models the authors find no negative effects for fathers.},

Research from Western regions such as the United States and Europe shows that the observation of occupational gender segregation can perpetuate gender stereotypes (social role theory; men are ascribed agentic traits, whereas women are ascribed communal traits). However, predictions from social role theory have not been well-tested in non-Western nations. In a study with 1,918 participants from 10 nations systematically differing in gender inequality, we investigated the extent to which target men and women in gender-segregated occupations are associated with stereotype-relevant traits. Results showed that 12 preselected occupations were perceived as gender-segregated in all nations. In line with social role theory, across nations, target men and women in male-dominated occupations were associated with agentic traits, whereas targets in female-dominated occupations were associated with communal traits. Targets’ gender, but not national-level gender inequality, moderated these results. The relevance of cross-national research for understanding gender stereotypes and pathways to reduce gender inequality are discussed.},

We find that workers do perceive human and algorithmic evaluation differently, even though both recruiters are given the same inputs in our controlled setting. Specifically, human recruiters are perceived to be more error-prone evaluators and place more weight on personal characteristics, whereas algorithmic recruiters are seen as placing more weight on task performance. Consistent with these perceptions, workers with good task performance relative to others prefer algorithmic evaluation, whereas those with lower task performance prefer human evaluation. We also find suggestive evidence that perceived differences in gender bias drive preferences for human versus algorithmic recruitment.},

  abstract = {[eng]In this dissertation a critical review of talent and the talent management (TM) literature is provided. Three key questions for TM research are covered within three chapters, defined as three different papers, with the aim to help fill the gap in solid theoretical foundations for TM research. Hence, it can be defined as mainly a conceptual dissertation. In chapter one, we deal with the question that marks the starting point for our research: What is meant by talent in the world of work? We questioned the meaning of talent, since it is critical in order to know how to manage it. By doing so, we offer an in-depth review of the talent concept within the specific context of the world of work, and we propose a framework for its conceptualization. We group different theoretical approaches to talent into ‘object’ (i.e., talent as natural ability; talent as mastery; talent as commitment; talent as fit) and ‘subject’ approaches (i.e., talent as all people; talent as some people) and identify dynamics existing within and between them, as well as implications for TM theory and practice. Finally, we discuss different avenues for further research aimed at developing the talent—and consequently, the talent management—construct further. Chapter two goes on to deal with the next challenging question: How is talent identified? Despite all the talk about talent and its importance for achieving new sources of competitive advantages, most companies report great difficulty in operationalizing and measuring talent accurately, reflecting the lack of theoretical foundations for talent identification. Building on from insights from different literature streams (giftedness, vocational psychology, and positive psychology literature), this chapter contributes to the establishment of a stronger theoretical basis for TM by discussing two components of talent (an ability and an affective component) that are complementary. Moreover, we identify three central characteristics of talent (manifestation in excellent performance, developed innate abilities and passion) that will help us to distinguish between talent, competence and potential; terms that are usually misused as interchangeable within the TM field. In addition, we argue how this distinction will help in talent identification. We also provide a summary with different discussed measures and methods to identify talent. By discussing managerial implications in terms of measures and methods, we provide practical guidelines for designing talent identification practices grounded in sound theory. Finally, in chapter three, we concentrate our efforts on the talent management construct through a proxy research question: How much do we know about talent management? Hence, we used a bibliometric method to both analyze the structure of the TM research and to define its boundaries and trends. Based on 703 peer-reviewed publications in English that appeared between 1990 and 2013, the analysis covers the following issues: productivity (e.g., number of papers published by author, country of origin, and author’s affiliation), visibility and impact (e.g., ranking of authors and documents according to citations, documents published in indexed journals), and collaboration (i.e., co-authorship). Our study shows underlying patterns in scientific outputs and academic collaborations and serves as an alternative and innovative way of revealing global research trends in TM. It should be noted that this bibliometric analysis is the first to address a complete and in-depth analysis of the structure of the field of TM as an academic discipline. It will allow new researchers in the field to be fully aware of seminal authors and must-read articles, as well as identifying those journals and institutions most closely related to this subject.},

In this paper, we develop a framework to investigate the tem-poral dynamics of gender and ethnic stereotypes by analyzing how the embedding geometry changes over time. We apply this approach to analyze embeddings trained over 100 years of text data. Moreover, we integrate U.S. Census data over the 20th century and demonstrate that dynamics of the word embedding track closely with demographic and occupation shifts over time. We systematically quantify changes in the embeddings of various classes of occupations and adjectives and their relationship to gender and ethnic groups. While the overall embedding bias has been decreasing, specific occu-pations (e.g. intellectual professions) are still associated with males and adjectives for physical appearance are closer to fe-males. We show that our approach can robustly capture global shifts – e.g. the feminist movement in the 1960s and Asian immigration into the U.S. – as well as changes in the biases associated with specific words. Temporal analysis of word embeddings thus opens up a powerful new intersection be-tween machine learning and quantitative social science.

We propose that gendered wording (i.e., masculine- and feminine-themed words, such as those associated with gender stereotypes) may be a heretofore unacknowledged, institutional-level mechanism of inequality maintenance. Employing both archival and experimental analyses, the present research demonstrates that gendered wording commonly employed in job recruitment materials can maintain gender inequality in traditionally male-dominated occupations. Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated the existence of subtle but systematic wording differences within a randomly sampled set of job advertisements. Results indicated that job advertisements for male-dominated areas employed greater masculine wording (i.e., words associated with male stereotypes, such as leader, competitive, dominant) than advertisements within female-dominated areas. No difference in the presence of feminine wording (i.e., words associated with female stereotypes, such as support, understand, interpersonal) emerged across male- and female-dominated areas. Next, the consequences of highly masculine wording were tested across 3 experimental studies. When job advertisements were constructed to include more masculine than feminine wording, participants perceived more men within these occupations (Study 3), and importantly, women found these jobs less appealing (Studies 4 and 5). Results confirmed that perceptions of belongingness (but not perceived skills) mediated the effect of gendered wording on job appeal (Study 5). The function of gendered wording in maintaining traditional gender divisions, implications for gender parity, and theoretical models of inequality are discussed. © 2011 American Psychological Association.},

  abstract = {Objective To investigate the rate of automation bias – the propensity of people to over rely on automated advice and the factors associated with it. Tested factors were attitudinal – trust and confidence, non-attitudinal – decision support experience and clinical experience, and environmental – task difficulty. The paradigm of simulated decision support advice within a prescribing context was used. Design The study employed within participant before–after design, whereby 26 UK NHS General Practitioners were shown 20 hypothetical prescribing scenarios with prevalidated correct and incorrect answers – advice was incorrect in 6 scenarios. They were asked to prescribe for each case, followed by being shown simulated advice. Participants were then asked whether they wished to change their prescription, and the post-advice prescription was recorded. Measurements Rate of overall decision switching was captured. Automation bias was measured by negative consultations – correct to incorrect prescription switching. Results Participants changed prescriptions in 22.5\% of scenarios. The pre-advice accuracy rate of the clinicians was 50.38\%, which improved to 58.27\% post-advice. The CDSS improved the decision accuracy in 13.1\% of prescribing cases. The rate of automation bias, as measured by decision switches from correct pre-advice, to incorrect post-advice was 5.2\% of all cases – a net improvement of 8\%. More immediate factors such as trust in the specific CDSS, decision confidence, and task difficulty influenced rate of decision switching. Lower clinical experience was associated with more decision switching. Age, DSS experience and trust in CDSS generally were not significantly associated with decision switching. Conclusions This study adds to the literature surrounding automation bias in terms of its potential frequency and influencing factors.},

In the current research, we thus examined how organizations might mitigate adverse reactions toward AI/ML-based selection processes. In two between-subjects experiments, we recruited online samples of participants (undergraduate students and Prolific panelists, respectively) and presented them with vignettes representing various selection systems and measured participants' reactions to them. In Study 1, we manipulated (a) whether the system was managed by a human decision-maker, by AI/ML, or a combination of both (an “augmented” approach), and (b) the selection stage (screening, final stage). Results indicated that participants generally reacted more favorably toward augmented and human-based approaches, relative to AI/ML-based approaches, and further depended on participants' pre-existing familiarity levels with AI. In Study 2, we sought to replicate our findings within a specific process (selecting hotel managers) and application method (handling interview recordings). We found again that reactions toward the augmented approach generally depended on participants’ familiarity levels with AI. Our findings have implications for how (and for whom) organizations should implement AI/ML-based practices.},

In this article, the authors seek to address this relative gap in the literature by building on previous research on the correlates and antecedents of career commitment and adding “new” variables to the framework. More specifically, they investigate the effects of a few previously studied factors such as job involvement, organizational commitment, and job satisfaction, and they add two more individual factors (need for achievement and work ethic) as well as some situational variables (organizational uncertainty/fear of job loss and job fit) that, to the best of their knowledge, have not been investigated in previous research. Furthermore, they examine the effects of extra-work variables (family involvement and number of dependents) on career commitment. Finally, they control for a number of key demographic variables. The authors find considerable support for the hypotheses that job involvement, organizational commitment, and job satisfaction are positively related to career commitment and find some support for a similar effect for need for achievement and work ethic. Furthermore, as predicted, fear of losing one's job was negatively related to career commitment, whereas “job fit” was positively related. The extra-work variables did not have any significant effects on career commitment. The implications for theory and practice are discussed.},

Evidence suggests that women, when poorly represented in the workplace, are more likely to suffer discrimination. In this study, we report the first-hand experiences of gender discrimination suffered by female directors and present the process of how they build resilience through developing coping strategies. Such resilience-building processes seem to vary with the length of board experience of female directors. At the outset of their board journey, they adopt avoidant coping strategies of denial and disengagement. However, with experience in boards, they gain the confidence to pursue the active coping strategy of seeking and extending support. This qualitative study is based on 42 elite interviews of board directors and is guided by the resilience theory, in the context of top FTSE boards. The article also discusses the contribution of the study to theory, praxis, and policy.},

  abstract = {Despite vigorous debates about the technical characteristics of risk assessments being deployed in the U.S. criminal justice system, remarkably little research has studied how these tools affect actual decision-making processes. After all, risk assessments do not make definitive decisions---they inform judges, who are the final arbiters. It is therefore essential that considerations of risk assessments be informed by rigorous studies of how judges actually interpret and use them. This paper takes a first step toward such research on human interactions with risk assessments through a controlled experimental study on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We found several behaviors that call into question the supposed efficacy and fairness of risk assessments: our study participants 1) underperformed the risk assessment even when presented with its predictions, 2) could not effectively evaluate the accuracy of their own or the risk assessment's predictions, and 3) exhibited behaviors fraught with "disparate interactions," whereby the use of risk assessments led to higher risk predictions about black defendants and lower risk predictions about white defendants. These results suggest the need for a new "algorithm-in-the-loop" framework that places machine learning decision-making aids into the sociotechnical context of improving human decisions rather than the technical context of generating the best prediction in the abstract. If risk assessments are to be used at all, they must be grounded in rigorous evaluations of their real-world impacts instead of in their theoretical potential.},

The authors examine the form in which gender ideologies cluster in the various countries. Five ideology profiles were identified: egalitarian, egalitarian essentialism, intensive parenting, moderate traditional, and traditional. The five ideology profiles were found in all countries, but with pronounced variation in size. Ideologies mixing gender essentialist and egalitarian views appear to have replaced traditional ideologies, even in countries offering some institutional support for gendered separate spheres.},

It helps in the screening of resumes without biasness. This chapter will identify different AI technology and various organisations using it fully or partially.Purpose: This chapter aims to get insights about various AI tools that assist human recruiters, save time and cost, and provide modern experiences. It will help identify various applications that are currently in use and their features. It also helps in finding out the benefits and the challenges faced by the recruiters and the applicants while assimilating those applications in hiring.Need for the Study: The study will be helpful to all those recruiting firms who are presently using AI or not using it to understand the benefits and challenges they might face.Methodology: The chapter will be based on reviews and industry reports. This chapter will include a study related to human resource (HR) functions where AI is used. To give more insights into AI technology, this study mentions various applications like Mya, Brazen, etc., and their usefulness in recruitment. Also, special emphasis would be given to the recruitment functions as most companies use AI. Some companies like Deloitte and Oracle are using AI fully or partially will also be incorporated.Findings: The study finds out that although many companies have started to use AI tools for recruitment, they have not explored all the algorithms that can be used to complete the whole recruitment and selection process. Companies like Loreal use AI for candidate applications and recruiter screening, but human recruiters stand strong for assessments and interviews. AI’s widespread use presents human resource management (HRM) practitioners with both opportunities and challenges.Practical implications: The basic idea of the study is to scrutinise the related literature and find out the features, advantages and limitations/challenges of using AI which would be helpful for recruiters in better understanding of the technology-driven recruitment.},

  abstract = {Purpose – As the shortage in the information technology (IT) workforce continues, it is becoming increasingly important to understand the cultural dimensions of IT occupations that attract or drive away potential IT professionals. In the present study, the authors take an occupational culture approach to study the cultural fit of newcomers to IT occupations and to understand how young people perceive the culture embedded in this occupational community as they become part of it. Design/methodology/approach – The authors take a sequential mixed methodology approach composed of two phases, one qualitative and the other quantitative. In the first phase of the study, nine focus groups and 27 interviews with college students were conducted to learn about the challenges and barriers that they personally experienced while becoming part of the IT occupational community. The second phase used results from the first qualitative phase to design a survey instrument that was administered to 215 IT college students who were currently or had recently been involved in IT work experience to evaluate their cultural fit to the IT occupational culture (ITOC) and its influence on their occupational commitment. Findings – The results suggest that women, ethnic minorities and those with less work experience encountered greater difficulty fitting into different dimensions of ITOC. The results also showed that cultural fit is a good predictor of occupational commitment and affective commitment in particular. Practical implications – An initial survey instrument was developed to measure cultural fit to ITOC. This instrument can be further modified and adapted to be used in the hiring process by HR departments to measure cultural fit to organizational subcultures, such as the one in the IT occupational group. Originality/value – This paper constitutes an important contribution to the rigor and development of the theory and research of human resources in information technologies.},

Drawing on an HMC framework, we outline a research agenda built around three key aspects of communicative AI technologies: (1) the functional dimensions through which people make sense of these devices and applications as communicators, (2) the relational dynamics through which people associate with these technologies and, in turn, relate to themselves and others, and (3) the metaphysical implications called up by blurring ontological boundaries surrounding what constitutes human, machine, and communication.},

  abstract = {Although equal opportunities legislation came into force in the early 1970s in Britain, the subsequent decline in occupational segregation has been regarded as disappointingly low. The explanation considered here is that the overall level of occupational segregation is the sum of two opposing trends which largely cancel out. Declining levels of occupational segregation in the full-time workforce have been hidden by the impact of the high degree of occupational segregation in the rapidly expanding part-time workforce, which is almost entirely female. Testing the hypothesis with data for trends over 1971–91 reveals the limitations of the widely used Dissimilarity Index and the Sex Ratio Index. An alternative approach is developed, which captures the changing importance of integrated occupations within the overall pattern of occupational segregation, and displays conflicting trends within the full-time and part-time workforces, as expected. This new approach to assessing trends in women's position in the labour force also offers advantages over the conventional ‘single number’ indices for cross-national comparative research, for linking the results of macro-level analyses of national statistics with micro-level case-study research, and thus for explaining continuities and change in occupational segregation and the associated sex differential in earnings.},

We present MOSAIC—a model of stereotyping through associated and intersectional categories—to explain how stereotypes from various demographic categories influence the expectations for, and visibility of, employees. MOSAIC makes sense of outcomes previously seen as anomalies and theoretically reconciles patterns of advantage and disadvantage that individuals experience (e.g., why Black women face less backlash for assertiveness but are less likely to be promoted and earn considerably less than White women). Extending intersectionality research to management scholarship, we introduce the concept of an associated demographic category, which we define as a category that bears an implicit cognitive link to another demographic category. MOSAIC proposes that perceivers integrate the stereotypes from individuals’ foundational, intersectional, and associated categories and that this integration generates amplified or diluted stereotypes. This integrated stereotype content then yields proscriptive, prescriptive, and visibility templates and expectations that explain how bias emerges. As such, MOSAIC advances microlevel explanations for how and why particular configurations of demographic categories yield predictable patterns of stereotypes, expectations, and evaluations.},

The second UK 2015 general election leadership debate comprised seven candidates, of which three were women. Using qualitative thematic analysis and adopting the notion that gender is ‘performed’, we explore three features of coverage of the debate. First, the ways in which the debate itself was constructed as a masculine activity through a series of highly gendered metaphors; second, how newspaper frames reinforced gendered notions of masculinity and femininity in respect of political leadership; and third, how the success of women in the debates was constructed as the emasculation of their male rivals. Crucially, we focus not just on the ‘feminisation’ of women in the political arena, but also on the ways in which masculinity is posited as the criterion for the evaluation of politicians of all genders.},

This article looks at the recruitment of leaders through advertisements. We address to what extent the ‘vocabulary of leadership’ originating in influential leadership theories is actively used in communication about leadership positions. All job advertisements (4,217) that appeared in a consistent source in the public domain in the UK (Times newspaper) were collected for a period of 15 months. Out of the total number of advertisements, 1,390 were advertisements for leadership positions (chairman, CEO or director). The information in these advertisements was recorded and content analysed. The analyses highlight what terminology organisations use in attracting the desired leaders. In general, ‘people oriented’ and ‘transformational’ terms are used far more than terms describing ‘task oriented’ or ‘transactional’ qualities. Differences were found between advertisements for CEO and lower level leader (director) positions that seem to reflect the difference in hierarchical level and magnitude of the leadership responsibility of these roles.},

  abstract = {We propose Predictive Permutation Feature Selection (PPFS), a novel wrapper-based feature selection method based on the concept of Markov Blanket (MB). Unlike previous MB methods, PPFS is a universal feature selection technique as it can work for both classification as well as regression tasks on datasets containing categorical and/or continuous features. We propose Predictive Permutation Independence (PPI), a new Conditional Independence (CI) test, which enables PPFS to be categorised as a wrapper feature selection method. This is in contrast to current filter based MB feature selection techniques that are unable to harness the advancements in supervised algorithms such as Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM). The PPI test is based on the knockoff framework and utilizes supervised algorithms to measure the association between an individual or a set of features and the target variable. We also propose a novel MB aggregation step that addresses the issue of sample inefficiency. Empirical evaluations and comparisons on a large number of datasets demonstrate that PPFS outperforms state-of-the-art Markov blanket discovery algorithms as well as, well-known wrapper methods. We also provide a sketch of the proof of correctness of our method. Implementation of this work is available at \textbackslash url\{https://github.com/atif-hassan/PyImpetus\}},

  abstract = {Empirical communication scholars and scientists in other fields regularly use regression models to test moderation hypotheses. When the independent variable X and moderator M are dichotomous or continuous, the practice of testing a linear moderation hypothesis using regression analysis by including the product of X and M in a model of dependent variable Y is widespread. However, many research designs include multicategorical independent variables or moderators, such as in an experiment with three or more versions of a stimulus where participants are randomly assigned to one of them. Researchers are less likely to receive training about how to properly test a moderation hypothesis using regression analysis in such a situation. In this tutorial, we explain how to test, visualize, and probe interactions involving a multicategorical variable using linear regression analysis. While presenting and discussing the fundamentals—fundamentals that are not software specific—we emphasize the use of the PROCESS macro for SPSS and SAS, as it greatly simplifies the computations and potential for error that exists when doing computations by hand or using spreadsheets based on formulas in existing books on this topic. We also introduce an iterative computational implementation of the Johnson-Neyman technique for finding regions of significance of the effect of a multicategorical independent variable when the moderator is continuous.},

In Study 1, we applied the Stereotype Content Model (SCM) to develop a novel classification of occupational stereotypes based on the dimensions of warmth and competence. We found evidence that occupations are reliably stereotyped along the dimensions of warmth and competence, and that raters agreed more on certain occupational stereotypes than others. In Study 2, we mapped the occupational stereotype classification onto demographic stereotypes from the SCM to predict occupational segregation in the United States. Supporting an occupational stereotype incongruence hypothesis, women were more represented in occupations characterized by high warmth and low competence; Asian people were more represented in occupations characterized by high competence; and Black and Hispanic workers were more represented in occupations characterized by low competence. This work contributes to the understanding of how individuals perceive occupations in society, provides researchers with a means for systematically comparing occupational stereotypes and demographic stereotypes by applying the same descriptive dimensions, and highlights the importance of occupational stereotypes for understanding and potentially alleviating occupational segregation.},

Its central argument is that gender stereotypes give rise to biased judgments and decisions, impeding women's advancement. The paper discusses how descriptive gender stereotypes promote gender bias because of the negative performance expectations that result from the perception that there is a poor fit between what women are like and the attributes believed necessary for successful performance in male gender-typed positions and roles. It also discusses how prescriptive gender stereotypes promote gender bias by creating normative standards for behavior that induce disapproval and social penalties when they are directly violated or when violation is inferred because a woman is successful. Research is presented that tests these ideas, considers specific career consequences likely to result from stereotype-based bias, and identifies conditions that exaggerate or minimize the likelihood of their occurrence.},

However, it is important to acknowledge that speakers and the content they produce and require, vary not just by language, but also by culture. Although language and culture are tightly linked, there are important differences. Analogous to cross-lingual and multilingual NLP, cross-cultural and multicultural NLP considers these differences in order to better serve users of NLP systems. We propose a principled framework to frame these efforts, and survey existing and potential strategies.},

This paper examines the prevalence and consequences of stereotype endorsement on well-being within the gay community. Specifically, we explored how gay men’s self-stereotype (i.e., personal beliefs about the stereotypes pertaining to one’s in-group) and meta-stereotype (i.e., believing that out-group members endorse stereotypes pertaining to one’s in-group) endorsement would be related to mental and cognitive well-being. The sample of 253 gay male participants (aged 18–78 years; M = 38.25, SD = 13.51) completed an online questionnaire assessing demographics, self- and meta-stereotype endorsement, mental well-being (depression, anxiety, stress), and cognitive well-being (life satisfaction, self-worth) measures. We found evidence that our sample endorsed both self- and meta-stereotypes, with meta-stereotypes being endorsed more strongly than self-stereotypes. Regression analyses revealed a unique pattern of findings about the consequences of endorsing stereotypes: increases in self-stereotyping predicted decreases in mental well-being, whereas increases in meta-stereotyping predicted decreases in cognitive well-being. Limitations and future directions are discussed.},

To answer this question, we analyzed job titles in online job advertisements from four European countries differing in achieved gender equality and egalitarian versus hierarchical cultural values (Switzerland, Austria, Poland, and Czech Republic). Results show that gender-fair job titles were more frequent in more egalitarian countries with higher levels of socioeconomic gender equality (Switzerland, Austria) than in countries with a higher acceptance of hierarchies and inequalities (Poland, Czech Republic). In the latter countries, gender-specific (masculine or feminine) job titles predominated. Moreover, gender-fair job titles were more prevalent in a female-dominated branch (health care) and a gender-balanced economic branch (food services) than in a male-dominated branch (constructional steel and metal work). Thus, our findings suggest that the language use in job advertisements indeed corresponds with linguistic, cultural, and socioeconomic aspects and may contribute to the transmission of gender (in)equalities and gender stereotypes.},

Studies have utilized a variety of different automated systems in diverse experimental paradigms to identify factors that impact operators? trust.Method:We performed a systematic review of empirical research on trust in automation from January 2002 to June 2013. Papers were deemed eligible only if they reported the results of a human-subjects experiment in which humans interacted with an automated system in order to achieve a goal. Additionally, a relationship between trust (or a trust-related behavior) and another variable had to be measured. All together, 101 total papers, containing 127 eligible studies, were included in the review.Results:Our analysis revealed three layers of variability in human?automation trust (dispositional trust, situational trust, and learned trust), which we organize into a model. We propose design recommendations for creating trustworthy automation and identify environmental conditions that can affect the strength of the relationship between trust and reliance. Future research directions are also discussed for each layer of trust.Conclusion:Our three-layered trust model provides a new lens for conceptualizing the variability of trust in automation. Its structure can be applied to help guide future research and develop training interventions and design procedures that encourage appropriate trust.},

Minority candidates with high cultural maintenance (CM) are particularly vulnerable to cultural bias in selection procedures, a process which has proved difficult to change. This paper aims to examine whether these effects may be moderated by recruiters’ perceived diversity outcomes; whether they view diversity as beneficial or threatening to the organization's performance. In an experimental study, participants belonging to a cultural majority group played the role of recruiters (n = 99). Their diversity perceptions were manipulated by asking them to think about, and discuss, either positive or negative outcomes of cultural diversity in the workplace. They were then asked to rate fictional profiles of minority candidates for a job opening. The results confirm that CM of minority candidates has a negative main effect on the ratings they receive in assessment procedures. However, as predicted, this effect is moderated by diversity perceptions. Recruiters who perceive individual differences in the workplace as positive and beneficial, give higher ratings to candidates who maintain their own culture. This provides a promising insight in possible ways to reduce cultural bias in selection procedures.},

The primary focus is to explain vocational behavior and suggest practical ideas to help people select jobs, change jobs, and attain vocational satisfaction. The theory allows us to predict the outcome of person-environment interactions, providing explanations for 3 fundamental questions: what personal and environmental characteristics lead to satisfying career decisions; what personal and environmental characteristics lead to stability and change in the kind and level of work a person performs over time; and what are the most effective methods for providing assistance to people with career problems. This edition provides some clarifications and revisions of the theory, discusses recent related research (1985–1996), and extends the practical applications of the theory in career guidance, social science, business, and industry.

We aim to fill this gap by providing an ethical analysis of AI recruiting from a human rights perspective. In doing so, we elaborate on human rights’ theoretical implications for corporate use of AI-driven hiring solutions. Therefore, we analyze whether AI hiring practices inherently conflict with the concepts of validity, autonomy, nondiscrimination, privacy, and transparency, which represent the main human rights relevant in this context. Concluding that these concepts are not at odds, we then use existing legal and ethical implications to determine organizations’ responsibility to enforce and realize human rights standards in the context of AI recruiting.},

Results show that the proportion of women was higher, on average, in occupations high in people orientation and verbal demands and lower in occupations high in things orientation and numerical demands. Mixed linear models showed a trend for desegregation during this period, as the proportion of women in people-oriented occupations has declined and a trend for an increase in the proportion of women in numerically demanding occupations was observed.

There has been continual debate about the boundaries of HRD ever since. Drawing on a wide and respected international contributor base and with a focus on international markets, this book provides a thematic overview of current knowledge in HRD across the globe. The text is separated into nine sections which explore the origins of the field, adjacent and related fields, theoretical approaches, policy perspectives, interventions, core issues and concerns, HRD as a profession, HRD around the world, and emerging topics and future trends. An epilogue rounds off the volume by considering the present and future states of the discipline, and suggesting areas for further research. The Routledge Companion to Human Resource Development is an essential resource for researchers, students and HRD professionals alike.},

  abstract = {Quantitative analysis is an increasingly essential skill for social science research, yet students in the social sciences and related areas typically receive little training in it--or if they do, they usually end up in statistics classes that offer few insights into their field. This textbook is a practical introduction to data analysis and statistics written especially for undergraduates and beginning graduate students in the social sciences and allied fields, such as economics, sociology, public policy, and data science. Quantitative Social Science engages directly with empirical analysis, showing students how to analyze data using the R programming language and to interpret the results--it encourages hands-on learning, not paper-and-pencil statistics. More than forty data sets taken directly from leading quantitative social science research illustrate how data analysis can be used to answer important questions about society and human behavior. Proven in the classroom, this one-of-a-kind textbook features numerous additional data analysis exercises and interactive R programming exercises, and also comes with supplementary teaching materials for instructors. --},

  abstract = {Ad platforms such as Facebook, Google and LinkedIn promise value for advertisers through their targeted advertising. However, multiple studies have shown that ad delivery on such platforms can be skewed by gender or race due to hidden algorithmic optimization by the platforms, even when not requested by the advertisers. Building on prior work measuring skew in ad delivery, we develop a new methodology for black-box auditing of algorithms for discrimination in the delivery of job advertisements. Our first contribution is to identify the distinction between skew in ad delivery due to protected categories such as gender or race, from skew due to differences in qualification among people in the targeted audience. This distinction is important in U.S. law, where ads may be targeted based on qualifications, but not on protected categories. Second, we develop an auditing methodology that distinguishes between skew explainable by differences in qualifications from other factors, such as the ad platform’s optimization for engagement or training its algorithms on biased data. Our method controls for job qualification by comparing ad delivery of two concurrent ads for similar jobs, but for a pair of companies with different de facto gender distributions of employees. We describe the careful statistical tests that establish evidence of non-qualification skew in the results. Third, we apply our proposed methodology to two prominent targeted advertising platforms for job ads: Facebook and LinkedIn. We confirm skew by gender in ad delivery on Facebook, and show that it cannot be justified by differences in qualifications. We fail to find skew in ad delivery on LinkedIn. Finally, we suggest improvements to ad platform practices that could make external auditing of their algorithms in the public interest more feasible and accurate.},

While privacy concerns in an online (website-) context are widely studied, research in the context of chatbot-interaction is lacking. This study investigates the extent to which chatbots with human-like cues influence perceptions of anthropomorphism (i.e., attribution of human-like characteristics), privacy concerns, and consequently, information disclosure, attitudes and recommendation adherence. Findings show that a human-like chatbot leads to more information disclosure, and recommendation adherence mediated by higher perceived anthropomorphism and subsequently, lower privacy concerns in comparison to a machine-like chatbot. This result does not hold in comparison to a website; human-like chatbot and website were perceived as equally high in anthropomorphism. The results show the importance of both mediating concepts in regards to attitudinal and behavioral outcomes when interacting with chatbots.},

  abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to analyse the ways the textual materials of job advertisements do the gendering for prospective expert positions and create a space for ambiquity/non-ambiquity in the gender labelling of this expertise. Expert positions are almost always openly announced and are important to organizations because they often lead to higher managerial positions. By gendering the prospective positions, the job advertisements bring forth repertoires strengthening the gendering of work and gendered expert employee positions. Design/methodology/approach This study draws on qualitative textual and visual data of open job advertisements for expert positions. The materials of the study are gathered from open job advertisements in two countries, i.e. Finland and Estonia with rather similar labour market structures in relation to gender positions but differing as regards their gender equality. Findings The analyses show that the gendering of expert work takes place in the job advertisements by rendering subtly gendered articulations, yet allowing for interpretative repertoires appear. The analysis reveals some differences in the formulations of the advertisements for expert jobs in the two countries. It also shows that in general the requirements for an ideal expert candidate are coated with superlatives that are gendered in rather stereotypical ways, and that the ideal candidates for highly expert jobs are extremely flexible and follows the ideal of an adaptable and plastic employee, willing to work their utmost. This paper contributes to the “doing gender” literature by adding an analysis of the textual gendering of ideal candidates for positions of expertise. Research limitations/implications The research materials do not expose all the issues pertinent to questions of the ideal gendered candidate. For instance, questions of ethnicity in relation to the definition of the ideal candidate cannot be studied with the data used for this study. Being an exploratory study, the results do not aim for generalizable results concerning job advertisements for expert positions. Originality/value This paper contributes to the “doing gender” and “gendering” literature by addressing the question of how and in what ways gender is defined and done for an expert positions prior the candidates are chosen to those jobs. It also offers new insights into the global construction of gendered expert jobs advertisements by addressing the topic with data from two countries. It further contributes to understanding the gendered shaping of expertise in the management literature.},

In order to understand the relationship between trust in computerized systems and the use of those systems, we need to be able to effectively measure trust. Although questionnaires regarding trust have been used in prior studies, these questionnaires were theoretically rather than empirically generated and did not distinguish between three potentially different types of trust: human-human trust, human-machine trust, and trust in general. A 3-phased experiment, comprising a word elicitation study, a questionnaire study, and a paired comparison study, was performed to better understand similarities and differences in the concepts of trust and distrust, and among the different types of trust. Results indicated that trust and distrust can be considered opposites, rather than different concepts. Components of trust, in terms of words related to trust, were similar across the three types of trust. Results obtained from a cluster analysis were used to identify 12 potential factors of trust between people and automated systems. These 12 factors were then used to develop a proposed scale to measure trust in automation.},

These models have shown state-of-the-art capabilities towards a variety of different NLP tasks, including question answering, content summarisation, and text generation. Alongside this, there have been many studies focused on online authorship attribution (AA). That is, the use of trained models to identify the authors of online texts. Given the power of natural language models in generating convincing texts, this paper examines the degree to which these language models can generate texts capable of deceiving online AA models. Experimenting with both blog and Twitter data, we utilise GPT-2 language models to generate texts using the existing posts of online users. We then examine whether GPT-2-based text generators are capable of mimicking authorial style to such a degree that they can deceive typical AA models. From this, we find that current AI-based text generators are able to successfully mimic authorship, showing capabilities towards this on both datasets. Our findings, in turn, highlight the current capacity of powerful natural language models to generate original online posts capable of mimicking authorial style sufficiently to deceive popular AA methods. This is a key finding given the proposed role of AA in real-world applications such as spam-detection and the investigation of criminal activity online -- where deceptive texts could be automatically generated to mimic authorship in order to mislead these critical AA systems.},

Drawing on gender theory this paper investigates horizontal segregation in the UK insolvency profession, as revealed through the lived experiences of female and male practitioners. It is shown that horizontal segregation pervades at different levels of practice and is undergirded by various elements of gender essentialism. Physical essentialism explains why insolvency practice has been traditionally gendered male. Interactional essentialism combines with the management of work-life balance to define the subfields of corporate and personal insolvency as masculine and feminine respectively. Gender essentialist assumptions also pervade the distribution of roles and the allocation of work tasks. Networks are identified as arenas for the reproduction and perpetuation of occupational segregation. The findings indicate the continuing potency of gender in everyday professional life, the limitations of diversity-orientated policies and the complexities of formulating transformative agendas.},

It covers all of the statistical models normally used in such analyses, such as multiple regression and analysis of variance, but it does so in an integrated manner that relies on the comparison of models of data estimated under the rubric of the general linear model. 　 Data Analysis also describes how the model comparison approach and uniform framework can be applied to models that include product predictors (i.e., interactions and nonlinear effects) and to observations that are nonindependent. Indeed, the analysis of nonindependent observations is treated in some detail, including models of nonindependent data with continuously varying predictors as well as standard repeated measures analysis of variance. This approach also provides an integrated introduction to multilevel or hierarchical linear models and logistic regression. Finally, Data Analysis provides guidance for the treatment of outliers and other problematic aspects of data analysis. It is intended for advanced undergraduate and graduate level courses in data analysis and offers an integrated approach that is very accessible and easy to teach. 　 Highlights of the third edition include: a~new chapter on logistic regression; expanded treatment of mixed models for data with multiple random factors; updated examples; an enhanced website with PowerPoint presentations and other tools that demonstrate the concepts in the book; exercises for each chapter that highlight research findings from the literature; data sets, R code, and SAS output for all analyses; additional examples and problem sets; and test questions.},

Method~ The authors ran the analyses using data from New York Medical College School of Medicine applicants from the 2015–2016 admissions cycle. For analysis 1, effect sizes (Cohen d) were calculated for GPA, old MCAT, MCAT 2015, CASPer (an online SJT), and MMI. Comparisons were made across gender, race, ethnicity (African American, Hispanic/Latino), and socioeconomic status (SES). For analysis 2, a series of simulations were conducted to estimate the number of underrepresented in medicine (UIM) applicants who would have been invited to interview with different weightings of GPA, MCAT, and CASPer scores. Results~ A total of 9,096 applicants were included in analysis 1. Group differences were significantly smaller or reversed for CASPer and MMI compared with the academic assessments (MCAT, GPA) across nearly all demographic variables/indicators. The simulations suggested that a higher weighting of CASPer may help increase gender, racial, and ethnic diversity in the interview pool; results for low-SES applicants were mixed. Conclusions~ The inclusion of an SJT in the admissions process has the potential to widen access to medical education for a number of UIM groups.},

  abstract = {Introduction: In a world characterised by volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity, change is the only constant. Over the years, human resource management (HRM) has evolved from conventional functions of hiring and firing to being a strategic partner in organisations. Similarly, there has been a paradigm shift in the landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) from being a mere searching tool to the design and development of intelligent robots. Over the years, AI has emerged into a collection of powerful technologies re-inventing different functional areas, including HRM. The application of AI in HRM is perceived as an optimistic opportunity since it ought to bring maximum value at minimum cost. AI focuses on building tools that exhibit human-level intelligence and discernment in making decisions.Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to draw deeper insights into the relevance of AI in different functional areas of HRM. Integrating AI into HRM functions such as talent acquisition, training and development, performance management, employee engagement, and the like can help leverage efficiency and create an engaging employee experience. In the wake of Industry 4.0, where digitalisation has become imperative, this chapter explores the integration of AI into specific HR functions for a synergistic competitive advantage in companies. The purpose of this chapter is to signify the integration of AI into four vital functions of HRM, namely talent acquisition, training and development, performance management, and employee engagement. The objective is to chart how companies integrate various AI tools in four specific HRM functions to enhance efficiency. Also, the companies willing to implement AI in their HR functions can refer to the case studies used as exemplars in the chapter.Methodology: This conceptual chapter is based on the secondary sources, which also build upon case studies of different companies that have implemented AI-enabled solutions and integrated them into different HRM functions and processes per needs. This chapter utilises the conceptual framework of both AI and HRM functions to give deeper insight into the challenges and implementation of technology-enabled solutions.Findings: AI is used in HRM functions to automate repetitive and operational tasks to shift the focus to more strategic aspects. Despite many advantages of AI and machine learning, very few companies are using it, and companies may integrate technology-enabled solutions based on the size and nature of business.},

According to this model, transforming creative potential into creative behavior results from a decision informed by one's creative confidence and perceived value of creativity. More specifically, the model posits that the link between creative potential and creative behavior is mediated by creative confidence and moderated by perceived value of creativity. We tested the model in two cross-sectional studies and in one longitudinal study. Across all three studies, we found evidence in support of the CBAA model. Implications for subsequent theory development and research are discussed.},

  abstract = {Deemed “one of the top ten data mining mistakes”, leakage is the introduction of information about the data mining target that should not be legitimately available to mine from. In addition to our own industry experience with real-life projects, controversies around several major public data mining competitions held recently such as the INFORMS 2010 Data Mining Challenge and the IJCNN 2011 Social Network Challenge are evidence that this issue is as relevant today as it has ever been. While acknowledging the importance and prevalence of leakage in both synthetic competitions and real-life data mining projects, existing literature has largely left this idea unexplored. What little has been said turns out not to be broad enough to cover more complex cases of leakage, such as those where the classical independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption is violated, that have been recently documented. In our new approach, these cases and others are explained by explicitly defining modeling goals and analyzing the broader framework of the data mining problem. The resulting definition enables us to derive general methodology for dealing with the issue. We show that it is possible to avoid leakage with a simple specific approach to data management followed by what we call a learn-predict separation, and present several ways of detecting leakage when the modeler has no control over how the data have been collected. We also offer an alternative point of view on leakage that is based on causal graph modeling concepts.},

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) models are now routinely deployed in domains ranging from criminal justice to healthcare. With this newfound ubiquity, ML has moved beyond academia and grown into an engineering discipline. To that end, interpretability tools have been designed to help data scientists and machine learning practitioners better understand how ML models work. However, there has been little evaluation of the extent to which these tools achieve this goal. We study data scientists' use of two existing interpretability tools, the InterpretML implementation of GAMs and the SHAP Python package. We conduct a contextual inquiry (N=11) and a survey (N=197) of data scientists to observe how they use interpretability tools to uncover common issues that arise when building and evaluating ML models. Our results indicate that data scientists over-trust and misuse interpretability tools. Furthermore, few of our participants were able to accurately describe the visualizations output by these tools. We highlight qualitative themes for data scientists' mental models of interpretability tools. We conclude with implications for researchers and tool designers, and contextualize our findings in the social science literature.},

With interpretability approaches, ML can now offer explanations for its outputs to aid human understanding. Though these approaches rely on guidelines for how humans explain things to each other, they ultimately solve for improving the artifact -- an explanation. In this paper, we propose an alternate framework for interpretability grounded in Weick's sensemaking theory, which focuses on who the explanation is intended for. Recent work has advocated for the importance of understanding stakeholders' needs -- we build on this by providing concrete properties (e.g., identity, social context, environmental cues, etc.) that shape human understanding. We use an application of sensemaking in organizations as a template for discussing design guidelines for Sensible AI, AI that factors in the nuances of human cognition when trying to explain itself.},

This paper considers the effectiveness of EU-derived laws, which regulate the use of these algorithms in the UK. The paper finds that while EU data protection and equality laws already seek to balance the harms of biased hiring algorithms with the benefits of their use, enforcement of these laws in the UK is severely limited in practice. One significant problem is transparency, and this problem is likely to exist across the EU. The paper therefore recommends that data protection impact assessments, which must be carried out by all employers using automated hiring systems in the EU or UK, should be published in redacted form. Mandating, and in the short term incentivising, such publication would enable better enforcement of rights which already exist.},

Data demonstrate the ideal worker norm is pervasive and powerful, even as employees begin critically examining expectations regarding work time that have historically privileged men.

However, the relationship between the perception of organizational politics and turnover intentions was only partially mediated by career commitment.

It also explored age and gender as moderators of the relationships between these determinants and customers’ behavioral intention as well as customers’ likelihood of using specific app functions across age and gender. Design/methodology/approach A research model, grounded in the technology acceptance model (TAM), used data collected from 751 hotel customers in the USA. The model was tested using confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling. Findings The results showed that three of the four proposed determinants positively influenced customers’ behavioral intention toward hotel tablet apps. Neither gender nor age played significant moderating roles in the relationships between the four determinants and the behavioral intention. The study also revealed age- and gender-related differences in preferences for specific hotel tablet app functions. Practical implications This study helps operators successfully plan for investing in and implementing hotel apps. It assists operators in developing effective marketing strategies by understanding factors influencing customers’ app adoption and between group differences in their preferences on app functions. Originality/value This is the first tablet app adoption study that extends TAM to the hotel industry. Thus, it extends the literature on technology adoption by exploring both existing and new variables and testing them in a new context.},

  abstract = {Digital platforms, including social networks, are major sources of economic information. Evidence suggests that digital platforms display different socioeconomic opportunities to demographic groups. Our work addresses this issue by presenting a methodology and software to audit digital platforms for bias and discrimination. To demonstrate, an audit of the Facebook platform and advertising network was conducted. Between October 2019 and May 2020, we collected 141,063 ads from the Facebook Ad Library API. Using machine learning classifiers, each ad was automatically labeled by the primary marketing category (housing, employment, credit, political, other). For each of the categories, we analyzed the distribution of the ad content by age group and gender. From the audit findings, we considered and present the limitations, needs, infrastructure and policies that would enable researchers to conduct more systematic audits in the future and advocate for why this work must be done. We also discuss how biased distributions impact what socioeconomic opportunities people have, especially when on digital platforms some demographic groups are disproportionately excluded from the population(s) that receive(s) content regulated by law.},

  abstract = {Two studies tested the social role theory (Eagly, 1987) prediction that role information would override the age-related agency stereotype. Although results of Study 1 showed that employed people were viewed similarly in agency regardless of target age, interpretation was limited because employed targets were most often imagined to be male and young homemaker targets were most often imagined to be female. To control for this, target gender was added as an independent variable in Study 2. As expected, agency and communion ratings of employed targets and targets who cared for a home did not differ by target age, but agency ratings of average targets were higher for 35-year-old than for 70-year-old targets. Communion ratings for average targets did not differ by target age. Target gender effects on the agency measure replicated Eagly and Steffen's (1984, 1988) results. The importance of context to understanding stereotypes of the elderly is illustrated.},

  abstract = {This work investigates the most basic units that underlie contextualized word embeddings, such as BERT — the so-called word pieces. In Morphologically-Rich Languages (MRLs) which exhibit morphological fusion and non-concatenative morphology, the different units of meaning within a word may be fused, intertwined, and cannot be separated linearly. Therefore, when using word-pieces in MRLs, we must consider that: (1) a linear segmentation into sub-word units might not capture the full morphological complexity of words; and (2) representations that leave morphological knowledge on sub-word units inaccessible might negatively affect performance. Here we empirically examine the capacity of word-pieces to capture morphology by investigating the task of multi-tagging in Modern Hebrew, as a proxy to evaluate the underlying segmentation. Our results show that, while models trained to predict multi-tags for complete words outperform models tuned to predict the distinct tags of WPs, we can improve the WPs tag prediction by purposefully constraining the word-pieces to reflect their internal functions. We suggest that linguistically-informed word-pieces schemes, that make the morphological structure explicit, might boost performance for MRLs.},

Our adversarial collaboration provides one way to resolve this debate. Examining people from four continents who differentiated groups in their country (N = 2356), we found lower consensus on groups' warmth/communion compared to agency/\textasciitilde competence and beliefs (Studies 1–4). Consensus on groups' warmth/communion was lower because people differed in self-rated agency and beliefs, and they inferred groups' warmth/communion from perceived similarity in agency and beliefs between the groups and the self (Studies 5–8). Previous ABC studies only examined consensual differentiation of groups and thereby did not find evidence for spontaneous differentiation of groups' warmth/communion. Instead, we next examined non-consensual (personal) differentiation of groups: People spontaneously differentiated groups by their agency/\textasciitilde competence, beliefs, and also warmth/communion (Studies 7 and 8). Based on these data, the ABC model and SCM concede that people spontaneously differentiate groups' warmth/communion and beliefs, respectively, providing one way to resolve the models' debate.},

While firms implement algorithmic decision-making to save costs as well as increase efficiency and objectivity, algorithmic decision-making might also lead to the unfair treatment of certain groups of people, implicit discrimination, and perceived unfairness. Current knowledge about the threats of unfairness and (implicit) discrimination by algorithmic decision-making is mostly unexplored in the human resource management context. Our goal is to clarify the current state of research related to HR recruitment and HR development, identify research gaps, and provide crucial future research directions. Based on a systematic review of 36 journal articles from 2014 to 2020, we present some applications of algorithmic decision-making and evaluate the possible pitfalls in these two essential HR functions. In doing this, we inform researchers and practitioners, offer important theoretical and practical implications, and suggest fruitful avenues for future research.},

This diversity–validity dilemma can be resolved by (a) reducing adverse impact through a variety of technical steps ( Ployhart \& Holtz, this issue, 2008 ) or (b) using affirmative action to increase representation of the disadvantaged groups. This paper focuses on the second approach. The paper begins with a very brief review of the legal bases of affirmative action and a summary of the research on affirmative action attitudes. This is followed with reviews of research on the ongoing existence of workplace discrimination, the economic impact of affirmative action on target groups and organizations, and stigmatization of target group members by others and by target group members themselves. Most problems with affirmative action apply only or primarily to preference-based forms, so nonpreferential approaches to affirmative action are recommended to increase the attraction, selection, inclusion, and retention of underrepresented group members.},

We manually audit the quality of 205 language-specific corpora released with five major public datasets (CCAligned, ParaCrawl, WikiMatrix, OSCAR, mC4). Lower-resource corpora have systematic issues: At least 15 corpora have no usable text, and a significant fraction contains less than 50\% sentences of acceptable quality. In addition, many are mislabeled or use nonstandard/ambiguous language codes. We demonstrate that these issues are easy to detect even for non-proficient speakers, and supplement the human audit with automatic analyses. Finally, we recommend techniques to evaluate and improve multilingual corpora and discuss potential risks that come with low-quality data releases.},

Study 1 investigated the content of stereotypes about older workers, focusing on warmth and competence as the two core dimensions in social judgement. As predicted, older workers were perceived as less competent but warmer than younger workers. Studies 2 and 3 investigated how these stereotypes interact with job requirements to predict age bias in an experimental setting. Further, they tested if warmth- and competence-related stereotypical inferences mediate the relation between candidate age and selection bias. Results showed that age bias was robust. Older candidates were discriminated against, even if the job primarily required warmth-related qualities, and independently of evaluators' own age or professional experience in human resources. Moreover, age bias was mediated by competence-related stereotypical inferences. Age bias was also mediated by inferences related to warmth but those inferences were opposite to the high-warmth older worker stereotype identified in Study 1. Implications of the findings for theoretical approaches to age discrimination and for organizational practice designed to combat age discrimination are discussed.},

A search of published articles, conference presentations, dissertations, and working papers yielded 172 usable studies with 836 effect sizes. Nearly all of the credibility intervals did not include 0, indicating the broad generalizability of the relationships across situations. Various ways in which fit was conceptualized and measured, as well as issues of study design, were examined as moderators to these relationships in studies of PJ and PO fit. Interrelationships between the various types of fit are also meta-analyzed. 25 studies using polynomial regression as an analytic technique are reviewed separately, because of their unique approach to assessing fit. Broad themes emerging from the results are discussed to generate the implications for future research on fit. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

By means of a 2\,×\,2 experiment, we show that a newspaper article portraying older workers in a stereotypical manner (i.e., high rather than low in warmth, low rather than high in competence) inhibits and evokes negative employability perceptions, resulting in a net negative effect on intentions to hire an older worker. Findings indicate that mixed-media portrayals have stronger effects on implicit stereotype activation compared to stereotype application. We propose a tailored media-based stereotype reduction strategy, whereby the negative component of older workers' stereotypes is replaced by stereotype-disconfirming information.},

The data revealed that stereotypical portrayals of older employees are more common in news media than in corporate media and mixed in terms of valence. Specifically, older employees were positively portrayed with regard to warmth stereotypes, such as trustworthiness, but negatively with regard to competence stereotypes, such as technological competence and adaptability. Additionally, stereotypical portrayals that do not clearly belong to warmth or competence dimensions are found, such as the mentoring role stereotype and the costly stereotype. Because competence stereotypes weigh more heavily in employers’ productivity perceptions, these media portrayals might contribute to the employability problem of older employees. We suggest that older employees could benefit from a more realistic media debate about their skills and capacities.},

The results show that distant ethnic outgroup members (i.{$\mkern1mu$}e., Moroccans) are associated with negative characteristics and issues, while this is not the case for close ethnic outgroup members (i.{$\mkern1mu$}e., Belgians).

Gender-targeted job ads are common, favor women as often as men, and are much less common in jobs requiring higher levels of skill. Employers' relative preferences for female versus male workers, on the other hand, are more strongly related to the preferred age, height, and beauty of the worker than to job skill levels. Almost two thirds of the variation in advertised gender preferences occurs within firms, and one third occurs within firm occupation cells. Overall, these patterns are not well explained by a firm-level animus model, by a glass-ceiling model, or by models in which broad occupational categories are consistently gendered across firms. Instead, the patterns suggest a model in which firms have idiosyncratic preferences for particular job-gender matches, which are overridden in skilled positions by factors such as thinner labor markets or a greater incentive to search broadly for the most qualified candidate. © The Author(s) 2012.

Second, how ‘hard’ are employers’ stated gender requests-- are they essential requirements, soft preferences, or something in between? Using internal data from a Chinese job board, we estimate that an explicit request for men raises men’s share in the applicant pool by 14.6 percentage points, or 26.4\%; requests for women raises the female applicant share by 24.6 percentage points, or 55.0\%. Men (women) who apply to gender-mismatched jobs also experience a substantial call-back penalty of 24 (43) percent. Thus, explicit gender requests do shape applicant pools, and signal a substantial but not absolute preference for the requested gender.},

A natural split in the relative frequency with which these meta-themes were coded demonstrates consistency in participants' view of stereotypes as cognitive, neutral, and functional. Definitions are similar to scholarly definitions and are informative about why stereotypes are maintained despite a societal prescription to avoid them. Results suggest that views about accuracy may play a role in this process. Participants who view stereotypes as accurate, appropriate, and valuable ways to understand target groups may use stereotypes despite the prescription of avoidance and may, thus, maintain stereotypes. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

We show that this distance metric can be cast as an instance of the Earth Mover's Dis-tance, a well studied transportation problem for which several highly efficient solvers have been developed. Our metric has no hyperparameters and is straight-forward to implement. Further, we demonstrate on eight real world document classi-fication data sets, in comparison with seven state-of-the-art baselines, that the WMD metric leads to unprecedented low k-nearest neighbor docu-ment classification error rates.},

We explain a range of approaches to determine the SESOI in psychological science and provide detailed examples of how equivalence tests should be performed and reported.

However, according to recent studies, resume analysis is still a time-consuming task. The primary focus of the model proposed – Smart Resume Selector (SRS) in this paper is to automatically choose the right candidate for a job profile which reduces the efforts, time, and extra cost spent. The SRS model proposed in this paper first segments a resume to extract vital information. The resume is then converted into tokens which are compared with the defined array of information and skill set as per the company’s requirement. An overall score is calculated for each resume and its area of expertise out of the basic 5 occupational categories. After performing the tests on over 200 resumes collected from datasets from Indeed, LinkedIn, AngelList and other datasets available online and comparing the desired output with the experimental output, an accuracy of 83.5\% was achieved in the general category resumes and 89\% in a specific category type. These findings will help to shortlist the candidate initially based on their resume for further process. It will automate the process of resume screening making it easy and time-efficient.},

An algorithm that simply optimizes cost-effectiveness in ad delivery will deliver ads that were intended to be gender neutral in an apparently discriminatory way, because of crowding out. We show that this empirical regularity extends to other major digital platforms.This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy.},

Specifically, that research on communication, and in particular on mass communication, has been, since its inception, burdened by a focus on effects, not just a focus on effects, but indeed, a search for effects as the raison d'être for the field. But as is often the case, a little bit of reading demonstrated that the received history of the field and today's lumping of all scientific or quantitative research in the field under the extremely limiting term effects is somewhat misleading. Instead, we found that, in the beginning, there was everything, and effects were, as we are arguing it should be, only a part of everything. This suggests that this chapter may indeed be simply re-thinking about communication. The preface to the first edition of the Zillmann and Bryant (now Bryant and Oliver) series of influential books on "media effects" (Zillmann \& Bryant, 1986) states that the book was conceived of as following in the foot-steps of the "classic anthology The Process and Effects of Mass Communication by Wilbur Schramm" (p. xiii) published in 1954. Interestingly, in 1954, process was given pride of place over effects. A brief perusal of our bookshelves yielded the following chronology: 1954, The Process and Effects of Mass Communication, W.

  abstract = {Widespread developments in automation have reduced the need for human input. However, despite the increased power of machine learning, in many contexts these programs make decisions that are problematic. Biases within data and opaque models have amplified human prejudices, giving rise to such tools as Amazon's (now defunct) experimental hiring algorithm, which was found to consistently downgrade resumes when the word "women's" was added before an activity. This article critically surveys the existing legal and technological landscape surrounding algorithmic hiring. We argue that the negative impact of hiring algorithms can be mitigated by greater transparency from the employers to the public, which would enable civil advocate groups to hold employers accountable, as well as allow the U.S. Department of Justice to litigate. Our main contribution is a framework for automated hiring transparency, algorithmic transparency reports, which employers using automated hiring software would be required to publish by law. We also explain how existing regulations in employment and trade secret law can be extended by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Congress to accommodate these reports.},

  abstract = {Purpose The technological evolution of job interviews continues as highly automated interviews emerge as alternative approaches. Initial evidence shows that applicants react negatively to such interviews. Additionally, there is emerging evidence that contextual influences matter when investigating applicant reactions to highly automated interviews. However, previous research has ignored higher-level organizational contexts (i.e. which kind of organization uses the selection procedure) and individual differences (e.g. work experience) regarding applicant reactions. The purpose of this paper is to investigate applicant reactions to highly automated interviews for students and employees and the role of the organizational context when using such interviews. Design/methodology/approach In a 2 × 2 online study, participants read organizational descriptions of either an innovative or an established organization and watched a video displaying a highly automated or a videoconference interview. Afterwards, participants responded to applicant reaction items. Findings Participants (n=148) perceived highly automated interviews as more consistent but as conveying less social presence. The negative effect on social presence diminished organizational attractiveness. The organizational context did not affect applicant reactions to the interview approaches, whereas differences between students and employees emerged but only affected privacy concerns to the interview approaches. Research limitations/implications The organizational context seems to have negligible effects on applicant reactions to technology-enhanced interviews. There were only small differences between students and employees regarding applicant reactions. Practical implications In a tense labor market, hiring managers need to be aware of a trade-off between efficiency and applicant reactions regarding technology-enhanced interviews. Originality/value This study investigates high-level contextual influences and individual differences regarding applicant reactions to highly automated interviews.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the definitions and usage of competence, especially in the context of training and development initiatives in the USA, UK, France and Germany, seeking to clarify the concept by incorporating knowledge, skills and competences within a holistic competence typology. One-dimensional frameworks of competence are inadequate and are giving way to multi-dimensional frameworks. Functional and cognitive competences are increasingly being added to behavioural competencies in the USA, while in the UK cognitive and behavioural competences are being added to the occupational functional competence model. France, Germany, and Austria entering the arena more recently, adopted from the outset more holistic, but different, approaches. After comparing these approaches, we argue that a holistic framework is useful in identifying the combination of competences that are necessary for particular occupations and to promote labour mobility.},

As a result, over 1\% of the unprompted output of language models trained on these datasets is copied verbatim from the training data. We develop two tools that allow us to deduplicate training datasets -- for example removing from C4 a single 61 word English sentence that is repeated over 60,000 times. Deduplication allows us to train models that emit memorized text ten times less frequently and require fewer train steps to achieve the same or better accuracy. We can also reduce train-test overlap, which affects over 4\% of the validation set of standard datasets, thus allowing for more accurate evaluation. We release code for reproducing our work and performing dataset deduplication at https://github.com/google-research/deduplicate-text-datasets.},

  abstract = {Automation is often problematic because people fail to rely upon it appropriately. Because people respond to technology socially, trust influences reliance on automation. In particular, trust guides reliance when complexity and unanticipated situations make a complete understanding of the automation impractical. This review considers trust from the organizational, sociological, interpersonal, psychological, and neurological perspectives. It considers how the context, automation characteristics, and cognitive processes affect the appropriateness of trust. The context in which the automation is used influences automation performance and provides a goal-oriented perspective to assess automation characteristics along a dimension of attributional abstraction. These characteristics can influence trust through analytic, analogical, and affective processes. The challenges of extrapolating the concept of trust in people to trust in automation are discussed. A conceptual model integrates research regarding trust in automation and describes the dynamics of trust, the role of context, and the influence of display characteristics. Actual or potential applications of this research include improved designs of systems that require people to manage imperfect automation.},

Combining the innovation diffusion theory (IDT) with the technology acceptance model (TAM), the present study proposes an extended technology acceptance model. The proposed model was tested with data collected from 552 business employees using the e-learning system in Taiwan. The results show that five perceptions of innovation characteristics significantly influenced employees' e-learning system behavioral intention. The effects of the compatibility, complexity, relative advantage, and trialability on the perceived usefulness are significant. In addition, the effective of the complexity, relative advantage, trialability, and complexity on the perceived ease of use have a significant influence. Empirical results also provide strong support for the integrative approach. The findings suggest an extended model of TAM for the acceptance of the e-learning system, which can help organization decision makers in planning, evaluating and executing the use of e-learning systems.},

Perceptions of algorithms, regardless of the algorithms' actual performance, can significantly influence their adoption, yet we do not fully understand how people perceive decisions made by algorithms as compared with decisions made by humans. To explore perceptions of algorithmic management, we conducted an online experiment using four managerial decisions that required either mechanical or human skills. We manipulated the decision-maker (algorithmic or human), and measured perceived fairness, trust, and emotional response. With the mechanical tasks, algorithmic and human-made decisions were perceived as equally fair and trustworthy and evoked similar emotions; however, human managers' fairness and trustworthiness were attributed to the manager's authority, whereas algorithms' fairness and trustworthiness were attributed to their perceived efficiency and objectivity. Human decisions evoked some positive emotion due to the possibility of social recognition, whereas algorithmic decisions generated a more mixed response – algorithms were seen as helpful tools but also possible tracking mechanisms. With the human tasks, algorithmic decisions were perceived as less fair and trustworthy and evoked more negative emotion than human decisions. Algorithms' perceived lack of intuition and subjective judgment capabilities contributed to the lower fairness and trustworthiness judgments. Positive emotion from human decisions was attributed to social recognition, while negative emotion from algorithmic decisions was attributed to the dehumanizing experience of being evaluated by machines. This work reveals people's lay concepts of algorithmic versus human decisions in a management context and suggests that task characteristics matter in understanding people's experiences with algorithmic technologies.},

  abstract = {Social media recommender systems play a central role in determining what content is seen online, and what remains hidden. As a point of control for media governance, they are subject to intense controversy and, increasingly, regulation by European policymakers. A recurring theme in such efforts is transparency, but this is an ambiguous concept that can be implemented in various ways depending on the types of accountability one envisages. This paper maps and critiques the various efforts at regulating social media recommendation transparency in Europe, and the types of accountability they pursue. This paper identifies three different categories of disclosure rules in recent policymaking: (1) user-facing disclaimers, (2) government auditing, and (3) data-sharing partnerships with academia and civil society.\&nbsp; Despite their limitations and pitfalls, it is argued, each of these approaches has a potential added value for media governance as part of a tiered, varied landscape of transparency rules. However, an important element is missing - public data access. Current trends emphasise exclusive data access regimes directed at particular, trusted regulators or researchers, but this approach has important limitations in terms of scalability, inclusiveness, and independence. This paper articulates the distinct benefits of public data access as a supplement to existing transparency measures, and suggests starting points for its design and regulation.},

Since the seventies, IS research has contributed to a better understanding of this process and its outcomes. The early efforts concentrated on the identification of factors that facilitated IS use. This produced a long list of items that proved to be of little practical value. It became obvious that, for practical reasons, the factors had to be grouped into a model in a way that would facilitate analysis of IS use. In 1985, Fred Davis suggested the technology acceptance model (TAM). It examines the mediating role of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness in their relation between systems characteristics (external variables) and the probability of system use (an indicator of system success). More recently, Davis proposed a new version of his model: TAM2. It includes subjective norms, and was tested with longitudinal research designs. Overall the two explain about 40\% of system’s use. Analysis of empirical research using TAM shows that results are not totally consistent or clear. This suggests that significant factors are not included in the models. We conclude that TAM is a useful model, but has to be integrated into a broader one which would include variables related to both human and social change processes, and to the adoption of the innovation model.},

  abstract = {Research Objectives and Methods: The key objective of this research was to give predictive information on what areas of human life and external influence affect technology trust. This objective was achieved first by theoretically discussing the foundations of technology trust and its antecedents and secondly by empirically assessing the relevance of the theoretical findings through partial least squares (PLS) analysis. Simultaneously, the relational importance of each antecedent and technology trust was observed. The secondary objective of this research was to propose a conceptual model that outlines the relation of technology trust, technology acceptance and technology-enabled performance. This conceptualization is presented in accordance with the theoretical framework of this research. Summary of the Findings: It was discovered that the individual disposition to trust has the most significant impact on technology trust. This indicates that it is always a long-term commitment for organizations to begin the work to improve the level of technology trust among their employees. Minor effects were observed with the following antecedents: organizational encouragement, advantage to use, expectation of technology usability and perception of user skills. The importance of these four antecedents is that through them it is possible to propose more concrete activities for organizations to increase the level of technology trust also within a shorter timeframe. Finally, a conceptual model is presented in the theoretical framework of this research that is targeted to clarify the relation of specific trust-creation activities and technology-enabled task performance for carrying technology trust research forward in the future.},

Yet modern hiring algorithms, based on “supervised learning” approaches, are designed solely for exploitation. Instead, we build a resume screening algorithm that values exploration by evaluating candidates according to their statistical upside potential. Using data from professional services recruiting within a Fortune 500 firm, we show that this approach improves the quality (as measured by eventual hiring rates) of candidates selected for an interview, while also increasing demographic diversity, relative to the firm's existing practices. The same is not true for traditional supervised learning based algorithms, which improve hiring rates but select far fewer Black and Hispanic applicants. In an extension, we show that exploration-based algorithms are also able to learn more effectively about simulated changes in applicant hiring potential over time. Together, our results highlight the importance of incorporating exploration in developing decision-making algorithms that are potentially both more efficient and equitable.},

We interviewed 15 recruiters and HR professionals about their experiences around two decision-making processes during hiring: sourcing and assessment. For both, AI-enabled software allowed the efficient processing of candidate data, thus providing the ability to introduce or advance candidates from broader and more diverse pools. For sourcing, it can serve as a useful learning resource to find candidates. Though, a lack of trust in data accuracy and an inadequate level of control over algorithmic candidate matches can create reluctance to embrace it. For assessment, its implementation varied across companies depending on the industry and the hiring scenario. Its inclusion may redefine HR professionals' job content as it automates or augments pieces of the existing hiring process. Finally, we discuss how candidate roles that recruiters and HR professionals support drive the use of algorithmic hiring software.},

Prior research has primarily focused on the statistical relationship between age diversity and organizational performance without empirically probing potential mechanisms underlying this relationship. Adopting an intellectual capital perspective, we posit that age diversity affects organizational performance via human and social capital. Furthermore, we examine workplace functional diversity and age-inclusive management as two contingent factors shaping the effects of age diversity on human and social capital. Our hypotheses were tested with a large manager-report workplace survey data from the Society for Human Resource Management (N = 3,888). Results indicate that age diversity was positively associated with organizational performance through the mediation of increased human and social capital. In addition, functional diversity and age-inclusive management amplified the positive effects of age diversity on human and social capital. Our research sheds light on how age-diverse workforces may create value through cultivating knowledge-based organizational resources (i.e., human and social capital).

We report an online experiment of compliance-gaining conversations with 915 dyads of strangers recruited from Amazon M-Turk. The extent to which two strangers accommodated each other’s non-content linguistic features predicted their behavioral compliance—monetary donation to a charity. This accommodation–compliance link was (a) observed, to some extent, in both conversationalists in the dyads, albeit moderated by seeker–target role differentiation, (b) partially mediated by perceived warmth and competence, and (c) was robust against alternative mechanisms including compliance-gaining strategies, personalities, and demographics. We discuss implications regarding communication-induced influence in mediated conversations and related interpersonal communication processes in general.How can a fleeting online interaction bring about compliance, especially for prosocial causes such as charity donation? This article finds that compliance is increased when there is a legacy of cooperative interactions (i.e., successful interaction rituals) on the part of all conversation partners—not just the one who seeks compliance. Such interaction can be identified when the individuals start to coordinate and accommodate each other’s language use (e.g., using similar expressions or adopting similar linguistic styles). The research shows that since online conversations often rely on text-based communication that lacks other channels with which to signal cooperative interactions, coordinated language plays an important role in gaining compliance.},

Data-driven candidate assessment is gaining interest, due to high scalability and more systematic assessment mechanisms. However, it will only be truly accepted and trusted if explainability and transparency can be guaranteed. The current chapter emerged from ongoing discussions between psychologists and computer scientists with machine learning interests, and discusses the job candidate screening problem from an interdisciplinary viewpoint. After introducing the general problem, we present a tutorial on common important methodological focus points in psychological and machine learning research. Following this, we both contrast and combine psychological and machine learning approaches, and present a use case example of a data-driven job candidate assessment system, intended to be explainable towards non-technical hiring specialists. In connection to this, we also give an overview of more traditional job candidate assessment approaches, and discuss considerations for optimizing the acceptability of technology-supported hiring solutions by relevant stakeholders. Finally, we present several recommendations on how interdisciplinary collaboration on the topic may be fostered.},

At the same time, many public sector organizations struggle with increasing the diversity of their workforce. Although many institutional forces contribute to the challenge, part of the solution is in how government recruits. This study presents the results of a field experiment aimed at attracting more and different people to apply to a police force by varying job advertisements in a postcard. The results suggest that focusing on public service motivation (PSM) messages is ineffective at attracting candidates that would not have applied anyway. Rather, messages that focus on the personal benefits of applying to the job—either emphasizing the challenge of the job or the career benefits—are three times as effective at getting individuals to apply as the control, without an observable loss in applicant quality. These messages are particularly effective for people of color and women, thereby supporting a key policy goal of the police to increase diversity of applicants.},

On average, roughly 50\% of such systems are considered failures or fall short of meeting the expectations set forth by management. The lost productivity and high costs associated with these shortcomings necessitate the identification of alternative frameworks for facilitating the successful acceptance and continued internalization of new technologies. Internalization is defined as the effective and continued use of a technology over time. As such, this paper introduces a conceptual model for examining the effect of trust and planned change initiatives on technology adoption behavior. We propose that technology trust and interpersonal trust, when coupled with planned change initiatives, lead to greater technology adoption and internalization. A series of propositions are introduced and examined between trust, planned change, technology adoption, and internalization.

Design/methodology/approach – A theoretical model was tested through a survey of 449 supply chain members using an IT innovation for part‐level visibility along the entire first‐tier of a major US automotive supply chain. Findings – Empirical results confirm the basic structure of the model, including the role of TT impacting users' perceptions of LTC relative to internalizing the technology. Results also identify several uncertainty reducing antecedents of TT and perceived LTC including satisfaction with the existing system, task‐technology fit, and prior similar experiences. Research limitations/implications – The study, although significant in terms of its power and the industry from which it is drawn, focuses on one‐tier of a US automotive supply chain. It would be useful for future research in this area to include multi‐tier supply chain members.

The results of the interviews enabled the author to identify which variables to investigate further through the use of a survey data collection protocol. In the present study, 273 first-tier supply chain members of the second-largest U.S. automotive service-parts logistics operation, who were recently introduced to a new supply chain management technology, were surveyed. Using a structural equation model, nine hypotheses were tested. As hypothesized, an individual's technology trust and interorganizational trust have an effect on perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, which further influence post adoption technology utilization behavior. The results suggest that even in supply chains where usage is mandated, the presence of technology and interorganizational trust can increase individual utilization of new technologies.

Nevertheless, our understanding of one of the model's key variables – social influence – remains limited. Drawing upon earlier studies that address the role of referent individuals to technology acceptance, this paper introduces the notion of ‘coalition’ as a social group that can affect the opinion of other members within an organisation. Our empirical study centres on an organisation that has recently decided to introduce Big Data into its formal operations. Through a unique empirical approach that analyses sentiments expressed by individuals about this technology on the organisation's online forum, we demonstrate the emergence of a central referent, and in turn the dynamics of a coalition that builds around this referent as the attitudes of individuals converge upon the Big Data issue. Our paper contributes to existing TAM frameworks by elaborating the social influence variable and providing a dynamic lens to the technology acceptance process. We concurrently offer a methodological tool for organisations to understand social dynamics that form about a newly introduced technology and accelerate its acceptance by employees.},

We contribute Baba: an integrated domain-specific language (DSL) and visual analysis system for authoring and reviewing multiverse analyses.

The Boba Visualizer provides linked views of model results and the multiverse decision space to enable rapid, systematic assessment of consequential decisions and robustness, including sampling uncertainty and model fit. We demonstrate Boba's utility through two data analysis case studies, and reflect on challenges and design opportunities for multiverse analysis software.},

  abstract = {Modelling the different factors that lead people to choose news articles is one of the key challenges for understanding the diversity of news diets – as a news diet is the result of a series of decisions for certain articles over others, a sequence of choices that was made by the individual consumer. This study sheds light on the interplay between content-related (past behavior, habits, preferences) and situational factors (positioning, saturation, control). The latter could offer possibilities to promote more unexpected news encounters that diverge from past news consumption. To test this, a Python-based web application for interactively testing different forms of news personalization over time was used. 247 respondents used the system over a two-week period, in total making almost 23,000 choices. Our results show that: (1) Selections are influenced by a strong positioning effect that follows a reading pattern (left-right, up-down). This effect is stable across devices, topics, and preferences. (2) How much control people are given influences the length and the amount of different sessions (personalization leads to fewer and shorter sessions). (3) With high control, the diversity of preferences influenced the diversity of selected news more, possibly widening gaps between diversity-seeking and -averse users. (4) How often a topic was chosen in the last hour negatively impacts whether it gets chosen again, showing saturation effects. (5) Clicks on sports and economic articles can be explained by preferences, but not past behavior; for political news the opposite is found. (6) There is no significant correlation between the actual diversity (presented or selected topics) and the topic diversity perceived by the users – in spite of clear differences in actual diversity between the groups. From this we can conclude the importance of situational factors in modelling news selection and their potential to narrow or widen the diversity corridor. In sum, our results contribute to a better understanding of the interaction of news recommender systems and humans and how this shapes which news articles get chosen.},

  abstract = {This article analyses old-age discrimination in managers’ hypothetical hiring decisions. We expect that older job candidates are less likely to be hired than equally qualified younger candidates. Statistical discrimination theory argues that when recruiters have more information about the candidate’s skills, age is less important for hiring decisions. Given inconclusive results of previous studies, we elaborate on the theory by focusing on the content rather than the amount of information. We argue that information is primarily influential if it debunks, rather than confirms, ageist stereotypes. To test this argument, a factorial survey was conducted among 482 managers in nine European countries. The findings show that older candidates indeed receive lower hireability scores, and this finding is robust across countries and sectors. However, we do not find that stereotype-rejecting information moderates age discrimination: it does not matter whether recruiters have information that debunks or confirms ageist stereotypes; age is equally important in both situations. Our findings suggest that for hiring decisions, the valuation of applicants’ skills and their age are largely independent.},

  abstract = {Background: As more and more researchers are turning to big data for new opportunities of biomedical discoveries, machine learning models, as the backbone of big data analysis, are mentioned more often in biomedical journals. However, owing to the inherent complexity of machine learning methods, they are prone to misuse. Because of the flexibility in specifying machine learning models, the results are often insufficiently reported in research articles, hindering reliable assessment of model validity and consistent interpretation of model outputs. Objective: To attain a set of guidelines on the use of machine learning predictive models within clinical settings to make sure the models are correctly applied and sufficiently reported so that true discoveries can be distinguished from random coincidence. Methods: A multidisciplinary panel of machine learning experts, clinicians, and traditional statisticians were interviewed, using an iterative process in accordance with the Delphi method. Results: The process produced a set of guidelines that consists of (1) a list of reporting items to be included in a research article and (2) a set of practical sequential steps for developing predictive models. Conclusions: A set of guidelines was generated to enable correct application of machine learning models and consistent reporting of model specifications and results in biomedical research. We believe that such guidelines will accelerate the adoption of big data analysis, particularly with machine learning methods, in the biomedical research community.},

When communicated through a chain of people, stereotype-relevant information tends to become more stereotypical, thus confirming the stereotypes held by recipients of communication. However, the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon have yet to be fully determined. This article examines how the socially shared nature of stereotypes interacts with communication processes to maintain stereotypes in communication chains. In 3 experiments, participants communicated a stereotype-relevant story through 4-person chains using the method of serial reproduction. Manipulations included the extent to which communicators believed their audience and other community members shared and endorsed their stereotypes, and also the extent to which they actually shared the stereotypes. The shared nature of stereotypes was found to be a strong contributor to rendering the story more stereotypical in communication. This is discussed in relation to the maintenance of stereotypes through communication.},

However, the volume and variety of these data makes them difficult to analyse and prompts the need for developing automated content approaches relying on a broad range of natural language processing techniques (e.g. machine learning- or neural network-based ones). In this paper, we discuss how these techniques can be used to detect political content across different platforms. Using three validation datasets, which include a variety of political and non-political textual documents from online platforms, we systematically compare the performance of three groups of detection techniques relying on dictionaries, supervised machine learning, or neural networks. We also examine the impact of different modes of data preprocessing (e.g. stemming and stopword removal) on the low-cost implementations of these techniques using a large set (n = 66) of detection models. Our results show the limited impact of preprocessing on model performance, with the best results for less noisy data being achieved by neural network- and machine-learning-based models, in contrast to the more robust performance of dictionary-based models on noisy data.},

Secondly, we explored whether these effects are moderated by gender and job status. Results indicate that age-based stereotypes are associated with negative outcomes for employees’ work and personal adjustment, and that these relationships are partially mediated by variations in work–age identity integration.},

Identifying the factors contributing to ageism is critical to inform policies that minimise its societal impact. In this systematic review, we gathered and summarised empirical studies exploring the key determinants of ageism against older people for a period of over forty years (1970–2017). A comprehensive search using fourteen databases identified all published records related to the umbrella concept of “ageism”. Reviewers independently screened the final pool to identify all papers focusing on determinants, according to a predefined list of inclusion and exclusion criteria. All relevant information was extracted and summarised following a narrative synthesis approach. A total of 199 papers were included in this review. We identified a total of 14 determinants as robustly associated with ageism. Of these, 13 have an effect on other-directed ageism, and one on self-directed ageism. The quality of contact with older people and the positive or negative presentation of older people to others emerged as the most robust determinants of other-directed ageism; self-directed ageism is mostly determined by older adults’ health status. Given the correlational nature of most studies included in this review, inferences on causality should be made cautiously.},

  abstract = {Purpose: This thesis seeks to identify what factors influence technology trust beliefs in emerging technologies, as opposed to non-emerging technologies, with which individuals have little prior knowledge or experience of. In particular, it explores the relationship between perceived threats to personal information privacy (PIP) and technology trust. This research is comprised of two studies. Study 1 explores a new framework to identify emerging technologies, unique PIP threats to emerging technologies, and whether these PIP threats effect initial technology trust beliefs. A number of covariates are also tested, including disposition to trust generally, disposition to technology trust, faith in humanity, economic environment, subjective norms and initial familiarity. Study 2 tests the predictive validity of the findings in Study 1 and further investigates the relationships between initial trust, PIP threats and the significant covariates found in Study 1. Initial technology trust models are developed and tested, and compared between emerging and non-emerging technologies. Methodology: A wide range of literature, including Information Systems, Psychology, E-Commerce, Economics, Science and Legal, is considered for theory development. Study 1 performs a controlled, randomised post-test experiment on 293 subjects with four emerging technology groups and one non-emerging control group. Factor analyses, MANOVAs and MANCOVAs are performed. For Study 2, PLS-SEM procedures test the proposed initial technology trust model against both emerging and non-emerging technologies. Findings: A framework to assess whether emerging technologies are truly “emergent” is identified based on their innovative and transformative nature. New dimensions for PIP threats are discovered (intrusiveness, omnipotence and invisibility) for emerging technologies. These are found to have a negative influence on initial technology trust beliefs. A new dimension for technology trust is discovered for non-emerging technologies called “data integrity.” Findings suggest situational normality should be removed from existing initial technology trust models as an antecedent for institutional-based trust in emerging technologies. The covariate variables all had a significant effect on initial technology trust beliefs. Further investigation using PLS-SEM supports the inclusion of the covariates in future technology trust research and demonstrates two different initial technology trust models exist for emerging and non-emerging technologies. Evidence indicates the cognitive process to evaluate initial trust in emerging technologies is distinct from non-emerging technologies and the two cannot be considered, or assumed, to be the same.},

  abstract = {If the same neural network architecture is trained multiple times on the same dataset, will it make similar linguistic generalizations across runs? To study this question, we fine-tuned 100 instances of BERT on the Multi-genre Natural Language Inference (MNLI) dataset and evaluated them on the HANS dataset, which evaluates syntactic generalization in natural language inference. On the MNLI development set, the behavior of all instances was remarkably consistent, with accuracy ranging between 83.6\% and 84.8\%. In stark contrast, the same models varied widely in their generalization performance. For example, on the simple case of subject-object swap (e.g., determining that "the doctor visited the lawyer" does not entail "the lawyer visited the doctor"), accuracy ranged from 0.00\% to 66.2\%. Such variation is likely due to the presence of many local minima that are equally attractive to a low-bias learner such as a neural network; decreasing the variability may therefore require models with stronger inductive biases.},

Results show that most HR professionals value social media and online search data, though some question its accuracy and usefulness. The majority recognize that because online information emphasizes personal and ascribed traits, it can potentially result in hiring discrimination. They use four strategies to cope with this discriminatory potential. Two strategies downplay the importance of online information by constructing it as the responsibility of individual job candidates and its role in hiring as marginal. Two other tactics involve guarding against discrimination, but in individualized and rather passive and post-hoc ways. Findings contribute to our knowledge of the organizational and labor market dynamics that contribute to inequality in the face of exogenous technological change and field-level uncertainty.},

Too often it appears that the most core construct – talent – is taken for granted in terms of how key stakeholders make sense of and give meaning to it in practice. This paper examines the talent definitions held by multiple organisational stakeholders and the criteria used in the practice of identification. Drawing from content analysis of over 200 interviews, our findings demonstrate substantial discrepancies between senior leaders’ and talents’ view on the meaning of talent within organisations. Moreover, there was little awareness of the identification criteria used by decision-makers that gives individuals the talent designation. Given the potential impact of this designation on employee attitudes, behaviours, and performance, the seemingly limited relationship between the meaning ascribed to talent and the identification criteria used in practice is likely to raise concerns about fairness and transparency. The findings indicate the absence of a shared and well-defined talent philosophy which we suggest is needed to guide talent management practices.},

  abstract = {Evidence suggests that consumers often hesitate to transact with Web-based vendors because of uncertainty about vendor behavior or the perceived risk of having personal information stolen by hackers. Trust plays a central role in helping consumers overcome perceptions of risk and insecurity. Trust makes consumers comfortable sharing personal information, making purchases, and acting on Web vendor advice—behaviors essential to widespread adoption of e-commerce. Therefore, trust is critical to both researchers and practitioners. Prior research on e-commerce trust has used diverse, incomplete, and inconsistent definitions of trust, making it difficult to compare results across studies. This paper contributes by proposing and validating measures for a multidisciplinary, multidimensional model of trust in e-commerce. The model includes four high-level constructs—disposition to trust, institution-based trust, trusting beliefs, and trusting intentions—which are further delineated into 16 measurable, literature-grounded subconstructs. The psychometric properties of the measures are demonstrated through use of a hypothetical, legal advice Web site. The results show that trust is indeed a multidimensional concept. Proposed relationships among the trust constructs are tested (for internal nomological validity), as are relationships between the trust constructs and three other e-commerce constructs (for external nomological validity), as Web experience, personal innovativeness, and Web site quality. Suggestions for future research as well as implications for practice are discussed.},

Most IS research employs trust as a measure of interpersonal or person-to-firm relations, such as trust in a Web vendor or a virtual team member. Although trust in other people is important, this article suggests that trust in the Information Technology (IT) itself also plays a role in shaping IT-related beliefs and behavior. To advance trust and technology research, this article presents a set of trust in technology construct definitions and measures. We also empirically examine these construct measures using tests of convergent, discriminant, and nomological validity. This study contributes to the literature by providing: (a) a framework that differentiates trust in technology from trust in people, (b) a theory-based set of definitions necessary for investigating different kinds of trust in technology, and (c) validated trust in technology measures useful to research and practice.},

The basic idea is to prioritize the efforts of human resource practitioners to focus on candidates that are likely of high quality, that are likely to accept a job offer if made one, and that are likely to remain with the organization for the long term. To do so, the system first individually ranks candidates along several dimensions using a keyword matching algorithm and several bipartite ranking algorithms with univariate loss trained on historical actions. Next, individual rankings are aggregated to derive a single list that is presented to the recruitment team through an interactive portal. The portal supports multiple filters that facilitate effective identification of candidates. We demonstrate the usefulness of our system on data collected from a large organization over several years with business value metrics showing greater hiring yield with less interviews. Similarly, using historical pre-hire data we demonstrate accurate identification of candidates that will have quickly left the organization. The system has been deployed as described in a large globally integrated enterprise.},

Considering the growing interest in sport, and sport management in particular, it is important for scholars to gain of better understanding of why people choose to work in the sport industry, and understand how employee identity may influence career decisions and subsequent work experiences. Thus, the researchers only interviewed employees who did not fulfill coaching or player roles, as these individuals could potentially work in other industries. Analysis of the data revealed how working in a sport context may present sexual minorities with certain advantages, such as an opportunity to enhance self-esteem and gain social acceptance. When confronted with unjust treatment because of their sexual orientation, employees used coworker social support and social mobility techniques to cope with these negative situations. Although the employees did not always view their sexual orientation as salient to their identity, they had all disclosed their sexual orientation, to varying degrees, to others in the workplace. Finally, though the participants did not engage in social change activities, some of their supportive coworkers attempted to proactively create a more inclusive work environment. Implications of these findings are discussed and practical suggestions are provided.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Introduction: Human resource management (HRM) is going through a transformation phase due to the pandemic. The COVID-19 crisis compelled the employees to work virtually. To mitigate the effects of COVID-19, several organisations heavily invested in artificial intelligence (AI) in the realm of HRM.Purpose: With limited studies on the paradigm shift in HRM post-pandemic and the role of AI, the study investigates and proposes a conceptual framework for the paradigm shift in HRM practices post-COVID-19 pandemic and the significance of AI. Furthermore, the study investigates the outcomes of the use of AI in HRM for organisations and employees.Methodology: A comprehensive review of the literature based on the guidelines of Tranfield, Denyer, and Smart (2003) and Crossan and Apaydin (2010) has been followed. A systematic literature review assisted in critically analysing, synthesising, and mapping the extant literature by identifying the broad themes involved.Findings: COVID-19-related economic disruption has led to a paradigm shift in HRM practices. AI-enabled HRM practices are now centred around remote and contingent workforce management, mindfulness, social capital, increasing employee engagement, reskilling and upskilling towards new competencies, etc. AI is making remote work seamless through smooth recruitment and selection process, onboarding, career and development, tracking and managing the performance, facilitating learning, and talent management. Post-pandemic, AI-powered tools based on data mining (DM), predictive analytics, big data analytics, natural language processing (NLP), intelligent robots, machine learning (ML), virtual (VR)/augmented reality (AR), etc., have paved the way for managing the HRM practices effectively, thereby leading to enhanced organisational performance, employee well-being, automation, and reduced cost.},

Literature stemming from different disciplines has been reviewed to summarize the main arguments in support of each of the three perspectives. Subsequently, these arguments are mapped on a continuum ranging from completely innate to completely acquired. We argue that an organization's position on this continuum entails important implications for its design of talent management practices, which we discuss extensively. By providing guidelines on how an organization's talent management system can be shaped in accordance with their respective talent definition, this paper is particularly useful to HR practitioners.},

This article introduces four talent philosophies that vary in their perception of talent as (a) rare (exclusive) or universal (inclusive), and (b) stable or developable: the exclusive/stable; exclusive/developable; inclusive/stable; and inclusive/developable talent philosophy. We discuss basic assumptions, talent-management practices, opportunities, and challenges for each of the four philosophies. Based on this discussion, testable propositions for future research are developed.},

  abstract = {HR managers have different beliefs about the nature, value, and instrumentality of talent—referred to as ‘talent philosophies’. In line with cognitive psychology, we reason that talent philosophies are similar to mental models that influence how HR managers interpret and use talent management (TM) practices within their organizations. In this article, we explore the prevalence of four different talent philosophies (exclusive/stable; exclusive/developable; inclusive/stable; inclusive/developable) in a sample of 321 HR managers. We then explore how talent philosophies relate to organizational context (i.e. size, ownership form, multinational orientation) as well as to HR managers’ perceptions of their organization’s TM practices. Cluster analysis corroborated the presence of the four talent philosophies in our dataset. All four talent philosophies were represented almost equally often in the overall dataset. Organizational size was found to be related to talent philosophies, such that HR managers who worked in smaller organizations were more likely to hold an inclusive talent philosophy. We also found support for the relationship between talent philosophies and perceptions of the exclusiveness or inclusiveness of the organization’s definition of talent, and its degree of workforce differentiation. Contrary to expectations, results did not support a link between talent philosophies and perceived talent identification criteria.},

  abstract = {In 1997, a groundbreaking McKinsey study exposed the "war for talent" as a strategic business challenge and a critical driver of corporate performance. Then, when the dot-com bubble burst and the economy cooled, many assumed the war for talent was over. It's not. Now the authors of the original study reveal that, because of enduring economic and social forces, the war for talent will persist for the next two decades. McKinsey \& Company consultants Ed Michaels, Helen Handfield-Jones, and Beth Axelrod argue that winning the war for leadership talent is about much more than frenzied recruiting tactics. It's about the timeless principles of attracting, developing, and retaining highly talented managers - applied in bold new ways. And it's about recognizing the strategic importance of human capital because of the enormous value that better talent creates.Fortified by five years of in-depth research on how companies manage leadership talent - including surveys of 13,000 executives at more than 120 companies and case studies of 27 leading companies - the authors propose a fundamentally new approach to talent management. They describe how to: create a winning EVP (employee value proposition) that will make your company uniquely attractive to talent; move beyond recruiting hype to build a long-term recruiting strategy; use job experiences, coaching, and mentoring to cultivate the potential in managers; and, strengthen your talent pool by investing in A players, developing B players, and acting decisively on C players.Central to this approach is a pervasive talent mindset - a deep conviction shared by leaders throughout the company that competitive advantage comes from having better talent at all levels. Using practical examples from companies such as GE, The Home Depot, PerkinElmer, Amgen, and Enron, the authors outline five imperatives that every leader - from CEO to unit manager - must act on to build a stronger talent pool. Written by recognized authorities on the topic, this is the definitive strategic guide on how to win the war for talent.},

Thus, whereas contemporary mores have produced a newspaper largely devoid of the most flagrant narratives of denigration that prevailed a century ago, today's newspaper continues to de-humanize and silence American Indians as it gives voice to the dominant culture. Furthermore, differences among the frames across story types support theories that structure and organization influence content frames.},

Automated decisions impact everyone, occurring routinely in education, employment, health care, credit, and government services. Technologies that generate tracking data, including smartphones, credit cards, websites, social media, and sensors, offer unprecedented benefits. However, people are vulnerable to errors and biases in the underlying data and algorithms, especially those with mental illness. Algorithms based on big data from seemingly unrelated sources may create obstacles to community integration. Voluntary online self-disclosure and constant tracking blur traditional concepts of public versus private data, medical versus non-medical data, and human versus automated decision-making. In contrast to sharing sensitive information with a physician in a confidential relationship, there may be numerous readers of information revealed online; data may be sold repeatedly; used in proprietary algorithms; and are effectively permanent. Technological changes challenge traditional norms affecting privacy and decision-making, and continued discussions on new approaches to provide privacy protections are needed.},

This study was designed to investigate automation bias, a recently documented factor in the use of automated aids and decision support systems. The term refers to omission and commission errors resulting from the use of automated cues as a heuristic replacement for vigilant information seeking and processing. Glass-cockpit pilots flew flight scenarios involving automation events or opportunities for automation-related omission and commission errors. Although experimentally manipulated accountability demands did not significantly impact performance, post hoc analyses revealed that those pilots who reported an internalized perception of "accountability" for their performance and strategies of interaction with the automation were significantly more likely to double-check automated functioning against other cues and less likely to commit errors than those who did not share this perception. Pilots were also likely to erroneously "remember" the presence of expected cues when describing their decision-making processes.},

Complementary congruence is the match between an individual's talents and the corresponding needs of the environment. The strengths of the individual complement the needs of the environment. The success of complementary congruence is judged by organizational level variables, and is the rationale behind personnel selection decisions.

  abstract = {Over the past few years, machine learning and AI have become increasingly common in human resources (HR) applications, such as candidate screening, resume parsing, and employee attrition and turnover prediction. Though AI assists in making these tasks more efficient, and seemingly less biased through automation, it relies heavily on data created by humans, and consequently can have human biases carry over to decisions made by a model. Several studies have shown biases in machine learning applications such as facial recognition and candidate ranking. This has spurred active research on the topic of fairness in machine learning over the last five years. Several toolkits to mitigate biases and interpret black box models have been developed in an effort to promote fair algorithms. This paper presents an overview of fairness definitions, methods, and tools as they relate to recruitment and establishes ethical considerations in the use of machine learning in the hiring space.},

  abstract = {Diversity in personalized news recommender systems is often defined as dissimilarity, and operationalized based on topic diversity (e.g., corona versus farmers strike). Diversity in news media, however, is understood as multiperspectivity (e.g., different opinions on corona measures), and arguably a key responsibility of the press in a democratic society. While viewpoint diversity is often considered synonymous with source diversity in communication science domain, in this paper, we take a computational view. We operationalize the notion of framing, adopted from communication science. We apply this notion to a re-ranking of topic-relevant recommended lists, to form the basis of a novel viewpoint diversification method. Our offline evaluation indicates that the proposed method is capable of enhancing the viewpoint diversity of recommendation lists according to a diversity metric from literature. In an online study, on the Blendle platform, a Dutch news aggregator, with more than 2000 users, we found that users are willing to consume viewpoint diverse news recommendations. We also found that presentation characteristics significantly influence the reading behaviour of diverse recommendations. These results suggest that future research on presentation aspects of recommendations can be just as important as novel viewpoint diversification methods to truly achieve multiperspectivity in online news environments.},

In reality there is no rule of thumb that applies to all situations. The sample size needed for a study depends on many factors, including the size of the model, distribution of the variables, amount of missing data, reliability of the variables, and strength of the relations among the variables. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate how substantive researchers can use a Monte Carlo study to decide on sample size and determine power. Two models are used as examples, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) model and a growth model. The analyses are carried out using the Mplus program (Muthén\& Muthén 1998).},

This paper proposes one of them, a sociomaterial perspective, which recognises the equal importance of human agency and material artefacts in the formation and reproduction of e-HRM practices. The review juxtaposes existing perspectives within e-HRM literature with that of the sociomaterial perspective to illustrate the kinds of complementary theoretical and conceptual tools that can be applied to address current limitations in our understanding of the impact of e-HRM. A research agenda is presented that suggests ways to explore the materiality of technology, wider groups of actors and their agency, and emergent practices around technology. The application of this perspective means paying closer attention to how actions and material artefacts are intertwined and constitute ‘doing HRM’, which therefore requires thick descriptions of the organisational context and how work is performed in order to understand how technology matters, for whom and in what ways.},

  abstract = {Humans are known to favor other individuals who exist in similar groups as them, exhibiting biased behavior, which is termed it as in-group bias. The groups could be formed on the basis of ethnicity, age, or even a favorite sports team. Taking cues from this behavior, we inspect if deep learning networks also mimic this human behavior, and are affected by in-group and outgroup biases. In this research, the behavior of face recognition models is evaluated to understand if similar to humans, models also encode group-specific features for face recognition, along with where bias is encoded in these models. Analysis has been performed for two use-cases of bias: age and ethnicity in face recognition models. Thorough experimental evaluation leads us to several insights such as that deep learning models focus on different facial regions for different ethnic groups and age groups. Large variation in face verification performance is also observed across different sub-groups for both known and our own trained deep networks. Based on the observations, a novel bias index is presented for evaluating a trained models level of bias. This is the first of its kind research that inspects deep networks for exhibiting in-group effects to understand bias in deep learning systems. We believe that a better understanding of how deep learning models work and encode bias, along with the proposed bias index would enable researchers to address the challenge of bias in AI, and develop more robust and fairer algorithms for mitigating bias as well as developing fairer models.},

  abstract = {This article celebrates the 50th anniversary of the introduction of John L. Holland's (1959) theory of vocational personalities and work environments by describing the theory's development and evolution, its instrumentation, and its current status. Hallmarks of Holland's theory are its empirical testability and its user-friendliness. By constructing measures for operationalizing the theory's constructs, Holland and his colleagues helped ensure that the theory could be implemented in practice on a widespread basis. Empirical data offer considerable support for the existence of Holland's RIASEC types and their ordering among persons and environments. Although Holland's congruence hypotheses have received empirical support, congruence appears to have modest predictive power. Mixed support exists for Holland's hypotheses involving the secondary constructs of differentiation, consistency, and vocational identity. Evidence of the continued impact of Holland's theory on the field of counseling psychology, particularly in the area of interest assessment, can be seen from its frequent implementation in practice and its use by scholars. Ideas for future research and practice using Holland's theory are suggested.},

The road to employment is however paved with obstacles, such as the often negative stereotypes and attitudes of employers and employees, which influence the treatment of people with disabilities at the work floor. In the present study, we build upon the Reasoned Action Approach to illuminate how and when stereotypes of employees toward people with disabilities relate to inclusive behavior at work. In a sample of 313 employee-colleague dyads, we found that the relationship between stereotypes (rated by employees) and inclusive behavior (rated by colleagues) is mediated by employee attitudes toward the employment of people with disabilities (targets). Moreover, work pressure functions as a boundary condition that shapes the relationship between stereotypes and inclusive behavior, in such a way that the relationship is stronger when work pressure is low. Research and practical implications are discussed in conclusion.},

Training and autonomy in the design of evidence-based assessment methods were positively related to their use, while negative stakeholder perceptions decreased practitioners’ intentions to use evidence-based assessment methods. Use of evidence-based decision-making procedures was positively related to access to such procedures, information to use it, and autonomy over the procedure, but negatively related to receiving outcome feedback.

But how do various digital media uses relate to social connectedness when face-to-face communication is not, or much less, possible? Drawing on survey data from 2925 US adults during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, we find that different digital communication methods display different relationships with social connectedness under stay-at-home circumstances with limited in-person interactions outside the home. Overall, digital communication relates to lower social connectedness. In line with notions from social presence theory, especially digital media lower in social presence (e.g. email, social media, and online games, and to some extent text messaging) relate negatively to social connectedness, while this is not the case for higher social presence media (e.g. voice and video calls). Our study has implications for theorizing about digital media use and social connectedness in times when face-to-face communication is less available.},

There is as yet no standard method for the ‘unsupervised’ inductive identification of frames based upon the content of articles. Three groups of core approaches underlie a wide range of work in this area, and we compare three techniques based on these approaches against each other and against manual human analysts. The three techniques are a k-means clustering algorithm together with a sophisticated natural language processing (NLP)-based feature selection process; evolutionary factor analysis (EFA), a factor analysis approach; and the structural topic model (STM). We use two datasets – one very focused and one extremely broad – as examples of the kind of frame analysis problems readers may wish to attempt. Even in a highly targeted dataset, we find some distance between the frames generated by computational analysis and those manually produced by our human analysts. The details of each method have a substantial impact on frame quality and interpretation. We find that the STM approach is the most effective for our narrow-scope dataset, but that it returns definite topics, and not frames, when working on our very broad dataset. We also show that we can get results emphasizing different parts of the framing problem by combining parts of different methods as a multi-stage process, rather than viewing available methods as simple plug-and-play models.},

This multidisciplinary review aims to contribute to the establishment of a stronger theoretical basis for talent-management by presenting a conceptual framework of talent in which the definition, operationalization and measurement of talent and its relation to excellent performance is clarified. We systematically introduce 11 propositions into the framework, building on fragmented insights from the literature—from the fields of HRM, gifted education, positive psychology, and vocational psychology respectively—that will guide readers in understanding and applying the proposed framework.},

  abstract = {Discrimination in the workplace is illegal, yet discriminatory practices remain a persistent global problem. To identify discriminatory practices in the workplace, job advertisement analysis was used by previous studies. However, most of those studies adopted content analysis by manually coding the text from a limited number of samples since working with a large scale of job advertisements consisting of unstructured text data is very challenging. Encountering those limitations, the present study involves text mining techniques to identify multiple types of direct discrimination on a large scale of online job advertisements by designing a method called Direct Discrimination Detection (DDD). The DDD is constructed using a combination of N-grams and regular expressions (regex) with the exact match principle of a Boolean retrieval model. A total of 8,969 online job advertisements in English and Bahasa Indonesia, published from May 2005 to December 2017 were collected from bursakerja-jateng.com as the data. The results reveal that the practices of direct discrimination still exist during the job-hunting process including gender, marital status, physical appearances, and religion. The most recurrent type of discrimination which occurs in job advertisements is based on age (66.27\%), followed by gender (38.76\%), and physical appearances (18.42\%). Additionally, female job seekers are found as the most vulnerable party to experience direct discrimination during recruitment. The results exhibit female job seekers face complex jeopardy in particular job positions comparing to their male counterparts. Not only excluded because of their gender, but female job seekers also had to fulfil more requirements for getting an opportunity to apply for the jobs such as being single, still at a young age, complying specific physical appearances and particular religious preferences. This study illustrates the power and potential of optimizing computational methods on a large scale of unstructured text data to analyze phenomena in the social field.},

Their decisions might affect everyone, everywhere, and anytime, entailing concerns about potential human rights issues. Therefore, it is necessary to move beyond traditional AI algorithms optimized for predictive performance and embed ethical and legal principles in their design, training, and deployment to ensure social good while still benefiting from the huge potential of the AI technology. The goal of this survey is to provide a broad multidisciplinary overview of the area of bias in AI systems, focusing on technical challenges and solutions as well as to suggest new research directions towards approaches well-grounded in a legal frame. In this survey, we focus on data-driven AI, as a large part of AI is powered nowadays by (big) data and powerful machine learning algorithms. If otherwise not specified, we use the general term bias to describe problems related to the gathering or processing of data that might result in prejudiced decisions on the bases of demographic features such as race, sex, and so forth.

The practical implication of this analysis is that stereotype change is not a matter of cognitive reorganization or generalization, but a matter of real enduring material change in intergroup relations.

Using a choice-based conjoint (CBC) experiment with typified screening scenarios, it was analyzed what aspects will be more important for recruiters: the recommendation provided by a hiring algorithm or the recommendation of a human co-worker; gender of the candidate and of the recruiter was taken into account. Design/methodology/approach A total of 135 recruitment professionals (67 female) completed a measure of sex roles and a set of 20 CBC trials on the hiring of a pharmacologist. Findings Participants were willing to accept a lower algorithm score if the level of the human recommendation was maximum, indicating a preference for the co-worker’s recommendation over that of the hiring algorithm. The biological sex of neither the candidate nor the participant influenced in the decision. Research limitations/implications Participants were presented with a fictitious scenario that did not involve real choices with real consequences. In a real-life setting, considerably more variables influence hiring decisions. Practical implications Results show that there are limits on the acceptance of technology based on artificial intelligence in the field of recruitment, which has relevance more broadly for the psychological correlates of the acceptance of the technology. Originality/value An additional value is the use of a methodological approach (CBC) with high ecological validity that may be useful in other psychological studies of decision-making in management.},

Using longitudinal data from accountants and M.B.A. students and cross-sectional data from employees of government agencies and public accounting firms, we developed and validated an instrument for assessing person-organization fit, the Organizational Culture Profile (OCP). Results suggest that the dimensionality of individual preferences for organizational cultures and the existence of these cultures are interpretable. Further, person-organization fit predicts job satisfaction and organizational commitment a year after fit was measured and actual turnover after two years. This evidence attests to the importance of understanding the fit between individuals' preferences and organizational cultures.},

  abstract = {Employers are central actors in shaping employment opportunities for older workers and facilitating longer working lives. In this chapter, we study the ways in which employers have adapted their attitudes and organizational policies and practices to deal with an aging workforce. We do so by comparing data from two large surveys on the topic of workforce aging among employers in the Netherlands, conducted in 2009 and 2017. The Netherlands forms an interesting case study as it is in the midst of transitioning from a society with high rates of early retirement to one with comparatively high employment participation rates of older workers and an increasing statutory retirement age. The results show that employers have strong concerns regarding the costs of employing an aging workforce and about potential negative effects of aging on organizational productivity. At the same time, however, employers have become much more active in offering human resource practices aimed at accommodating and training older workers, and employers are overall more supportive of work at higher ages. Overall, we identify a growing sense of urgency among employers to invest in longer working lives and to ensure the long-term workability of older workers. However, there remains a strong desire for policy changes that offer a lower statutory retirement age for workers in physically demanding jobs or a more attainable form of part-time retirement to ease the transition to longer working lives.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to examine new directions for diversity scholarship in the context of future of work or advanced technological shifts that are impacting organizations and society. It proposes that both new opportunities and challenges are likely to emerge for individuals and offers considerations around ethics, inequalities and global dimensions as relevant conversations within this domain.,The paper provides an overview of new technological advances in the domains of artificial intelligence, automation and the gig economy. It then layers considerations related to diversity within this context, focusing on issues of relevance to mainstream, critical and transnational traditions within diversity scholarship.,It is likely that technological shifts will impact several domains of diversity scholarship including how we define “diversity,” and the value and appropriateness of using advanced technologies to replace certain jobs that are predominantly held by underrepresented groups. Furthermore, the paper outlines ways in which bias, ethical considerations and emergent digital inequalities will become important conversations within diversity research in the context of future of work.,This paper brings together diversity scholarship and future of work conversations in assessing the ways such research and trends will intersect and provides insights about future directions that diversity-focused research should take to address and understand the consequences of rapid technological advances for inclusion.},

  abstract = {Ageism in the workplace has documented detrimental consequences for its victims, but its effects on those who hold ageist views are rarely investigated. A cross‐sectional study and a longitudinal study examined ageism toward both younger and older workers and its relation to intergroup contact, work behaviors, organizational identification, and the well‐being of prejudiced individuals. It was hypothesized that ageism would predict prejudiced individuals’ behaviors toward co‐workers, identification with their organization, and vitality at work, indirectly through intergroup anxiety and quality of intergroup contact. Overall, 647 employees aged 24–62 years provided data on the variables of interest. Both studies suggested that ageist views worsened the quality of intergroup contact, which in turn increased counterproductive behaviors toward co‐workers and decreased identification with the organization. Moreover, ageism marginally predicted vitality at work longitudinally through the mediation of quality of intergroup contact. No support emerged for the mediational role of intergroup anxiety. Theoretical explanations for these findings and their practical implications are discussed.},

  abstract = {Objective: Our aim was to review empirical studies of complacency and bias in human interaction with automated and decision support systems and provide an integrated theoretical model for their explanation., Background: Automation-related complacency and automation bias have typically been considered separately and independently., Methods: Studies on complacency and automation bias were analyzed with respect to the cognitive processes involved., Results: Automation complacency occurs under conditions of multiple-task load, when manual tasks compete with the automated task for the operator’s attention. Automation complacency is found in both naive and expert participants and cannot be overcome with simple practice. Automation bias results in making both omission and commission errors when decision aids are imperfect.Automation bias occurs in both naive and expert participants, cannot be prevented by training or instructions, and can affect decision making in individuals as well as in teams.While automation bias has been conceived of as a special case of decision bias, our analysis suggests that it also depends on attentional processes similar to those involved in automation-related complacency., Conclusion: Complacency and automation bias represent different manifestations of overlapping automation-induced phenomena, with attention playing a central role. An integrated model of complacency and automation bias shows that they result from the dynamic interaction of personal, situational, and automation-related characteristics., Application: The integrated model and attentional synthesis provides a heuristic framework for further research on complacency and automation bias and design options for mitigating such effects in automated and decision support systems.},

However, in such an HRM context where multiple stakeholders are complexly intertwined with different incentives, it is problematic to design AI reflecting one stakeholder group's needs (e.g., enterprises, HR managers). Our research aims to investigate what tensions surrounding AI in HRM exist among stakeholders and explore design solutions to balance the tensions. By conducting stakeholder-centered participatory workshops with diverse stakeholders (including employees, employers/HR teams, and AI/business experts), we identified five major tensions: 1) divergent perspectives on fairness, 2) the accuracy of AI, 3) the transparency of the algorithm and its decision process, 4) the interpretability of algorithmic decisions, and 5) the trade-off between productivity and inhumanity. We present stakeholder-centered design ideas for solutions to mitigate these tensions and further discuss how to promote harmony among various stakeholders at the workplace.},

These results provide insight into how and when real-world interventions aimed at altering the acquisition of racial stereotypes may be implemented.},

  abstract = {This paper aims to predict consumer acceptance of e-commerce by proposing a set of key drivers for engaging consumers in on-line transactions. The primary constructs for capturing consumer acceptance of e-commerce are intention to transact and on-line transaction behavior. Following the theory of reasoned action (TRA) as applied to a technology-driven environment, technology acceptance model (TAM) variables (perceived usefulness and ease of use) are posited as key drivers of e-commerce acceptance. The practical utility of TAM stems from the fact that e-commerce is technology-driven. The proposed model integrates trust and perceived risk, which are incorporated given the implicit uncertainty of the e-commerce environment. The proposed integration of the hypothesized independent variables is justified by placing all the variables under the nomological TRA structure and proposing their interrelationships. The resulting research model is tested using data from two empirical studies. The first, exploratory study comprises three experiential scenarios with 103 students. The second, confirmatory study uses a sample of 155 on-line consumers. Both studies strongly support the e-commerce acceptance model by validating the proposed hypotheses. The paper discusses the implications for e-commerce theory, research, and practice, and makes several suggestions for future research.},

Additionally, this paper discusses the identification of dishonest behaviour to increase the job offer success during algorithm-based data screening. In the age of digital transformation, researchers and practitioners explore the possibilities of predictive analytics in human resource recruitment. Predictive data modelling enables hiring managers to discover attrition, reduce cognitive bias, and identify the compatibility between job candidates and organizational environments. The unified theory of technology acceptance and usage (UTAUT) will be used to identify the intention and use behaviour of hiring managers when it comes to the application of predictive HR analytics. It will also be explored how the actual system use impacts key recruitment performance indicators. The structural relationships of the UTAUT model will be examined by an empirical questionnaire and a partial least square structural equation model (PLS-SEM). To predict the misrepresentation and dishonesty practised by job candidates during algorithm-based data screening, the theory of planned behaviour is applied in conjunction with semi-structured interviews. This research uncovers to what degree human resource managers trust, accept, and integrate predictive HR analytics in daily routine. Further, data modellers and researchers should be able to test, improve, and optimize future machine-learning algorithms based on the dishonest behavioural themes identified in this research study. Finally, this research will show how software process improvement (SPI) initiatives can be constantly improved by machine learning algorithms and user group requirements.},

Current knowledge about competencies required in Industry 4.0 is scarce. The goal of this paper is to develop a profile of Industry 4.0 job advertisements, using text mining on publicly available job advertisements, which are often used as a channel for collecting relevant information about the required knowledge and skills in rapid-changing industries. We searched website, which publishes job advertisements, related to Industry 4.0, and performed text mining analysis on the data collected from those job advertisements. Analysis of the job advertisements revealed that most of them were for full time entry; associate and mid-senior level management positions and mainly came from the United States and Germany. Text mining analysis resulted in two groups of job profiles. The first group of job profiles was focused solely on the knowledge related to Industry 4.0: cyberphysical systems and the Internet of things for robotized production; and smart production design and production control. The second group of job profiles was focused on more general knowledge areas, which are adapted to Industry 4.0: supply change management, customer satisfaction, and enterprise software. Topic mining was conducted on the extracted phrases generating various multidisciplinary job profiles. Higher educational institutions, human resources professionals, as well as experts that are already employed or aspire to be employed in Industry 4.0 organizations, would benefit from the results of our analysis.},

Additionally, we investigated whether the occurrence and extent of children's prosocial behavior changed when being repeated and whether the behavior modeled by the robot affected children's norms of prosocial behavior. In a one-factorial experiment (weakly prosocial robot vs. strongly prosocial robot), 61 children aged 8 to 10 and a social robot alternately played four rounds of a game against a computer and, after each round, could decide to give away stickers. Children who saw a strongly prosocial robot gave away more stickers than children who saw a weakly prosocial robot. A strongly prosocial robot also increased children's perception of how many other children engage in prosocial behavior (i.e., descriptive norms). The strongly prosocial robot affected the occurrence of prosocial behavior only in the first round, whereas its effect on the extent of children's prosocial behavior was most distinct in the last round. Our study suggests that the principles of social learning also apply to whether children learn prosocial behavior from robots.},

We use a regression discontinuity design to analyse the effect of the increase in retirement age on overall job satisfaction and satisfaction with the organisation’s personnel policy. Date of birth was used as a sharp cut-off to assign workers to the intervention or comparison group. The increase had no effect on overall job satisfaction. An effect was only observed for satisfaction with the personnel policy in one of the groups analysed. Further, there was only a significant effect if the statutory retirement age was increased by seven months, but this relation was no longer significant when controlling for the difference in days between the date of birth and the cut-off.},

This article examines 16 selection strategies hypothesized to minimize racioethnic and sex subgroup differences and adverse impact and, hence, balance diversity and validity. Rather than presenting a highly technical review, our purpose is to provide practitioners with a concise summary, paying particular attention to comparing and contrasting the effectiveness of the strategies and reporting new developments. The paper is organized around 4 key questions: (a) Which strategies are most effective for reducing subgroup differences? (b) Which strategies do not involve a validity tradeoff? (c) What are the major new developments in strategies for reducing adverse impact? (d) What are the major new developments in alternative predictor measurement methods (e.g., interviews, situational judgment tests, assessment centers) for reducing adverse impact? We then conclude with recommendations and caveats for how to best balance diversity and validity. These ideas are developed further in Kravitz (this issue, 2008) , who considers even broader approaches for solving the diversity–validity dilemma.},

Building upon signaling theory and the configurational approach, this study characterizes actual IT and HR competencies that firms signal when recruiting for HR manager positions. A content analysis of 207 online job advertisements of HR manager positions is first conducted. Using factor analysis, three bundles of competencies are unveiled: IT, strategy, and employee and workplace well-being. Then, a cluster analysis approach that combines hierarchical and non-hierarchical clustering algorithms is applied, followed by discriminant function analysis for validation. The study uncovers three strongly separated clusters of recruiting organizations based on required IT and HR competencies for HR manager positions. The clusters are labeled according to their dominant required competencies: (1) strategy proponents −10\% (2) technology proponents −30\%, and (3) basic proponents −60\%. The proposed classification goes beyond the normative understanding of IT competencies for HR managers and the way they combine with HR competencies: it provides a well-structured and parsimonious lens that is useful for recruiters, applicants, and educators.},

  abstract = {Categorizing an individual as a friend or foe plays a pivotal role in navigating the social world. According to the stereotype content model (SCM), social perception relies on two fundamental dimensions, warmth and competence, which allow us to process the intentions of others and their ability to enact those intentions, respectively. Social cognition research indicates that, in categorization tasks, people tend to classify other individuals as more likely to belong to the out-group than the in-group ( in-group overexclusion effect, IOE) when lacking diagnostic information, probably with the aim of protecting in-group integrity. Here, we explored the role of warmth and competence in group-membership decisions by testing 62 participants in a social-categorization task consisting of 150 neutral faces. We assessed whether (a) warmth and competence ratings could predict the in-group/out-group categorization, and (b) the reliance on these two dimensions differed in low-IOE versus high-IOE participants. Data showed that high ratings of warmth and competence were necessary to categorize a face as in-group. Moreover, while low-IOE participants relied on warmth, high-IOE participants relied on competence. This finding suggests that the proneness to include/exclude unknown identities in/from one's own in-group is related to individual differences in the reliance on SCM social dimensions. Furthermore, the primacy of the warmth effect seems not to represent a universal phenomenon adopted in the context of social evaluation.},

The implementation of these instruments can best be understood as the result of an interaction between four categories: the identified internal need for certain groups of high potentials; the scarcity of these groups of high potentials in the market; the attitudes, opinions, and strategies within human resources; and the technological capabilities. Depending on the situation, different recruitment instruments are used to recruit high potentials. However, the interviewees did not use an explicit high potential recruitment profile, though they implicitly search for varying combinations of high-potential characteristics such as: intelligence and agility, engagement, the ability to perform in various environments, and the ability to manage one’s energy levels.},

Thus, the aim of this research was to identify the implicit criteria used for the selection of high-potential employees in recruitment and development settings in the pharmaceutical industry. Design/methodology/approach: A semi-structured interview guide was developed and used to collect data from 15 European and US recruiters in the pharmaceutical sector. The interview guide included an embedded association test to identify potential differences between implicit assumptions about high potentials and verbalized criteria among participants. Findings: These include differences and similarities between the criteria to define high potentials and the implicit assumptions HR professionals use in their initial selection of employees who are selected for further assessment and development programmes. Research limitations/implications: Size of the sample is a limitation. Therefore, the conclusions drawn from this study should be treated with a degree of caution. Practical implications: Learning how HR professionals use implicit assumptions about potential recruits should inform practitioners about selection, promotion and training strategies. Given the increasing application of automated search algorithms to identify and select high potentials for recruitment, development and promotion purposes, future studies should account for the differences between used and verbalized criteria underlying the development of these systems. Originality/value: This study shows how the used implicit assumptions of HR professionals about high potentials differ from verbalized statements and guidelines.},

We examined whether professional committees used different criteria in their performance appraisal of male and female employees and how gender of committee members influences this outcome. The evidence showed that men were primarily evaluated on the basis of their competence, while women were evaluated on the basis of their performance in all the three (evaluative) criteria. Interestingly, using mixed compared with same gender committee members resulted in higher use of competence-related terms rather than sociability and morality ones, regardless of gender of employees. Overall, the evidence reveals that mixed-gender committees provide similar appraisals of male and female employees based on competence, suggesting that they might be an effective way to reduce gender bias in the performance appraisals.},

  abstract = {Purpose – In this socio‐economic climate there may still be budget for talent development, but it might not be as much as we have grown accustomed to. There is a growing need for effective, sustainable and prudent programs: the question is “how?” This paper aims to address this issue. Design/methodology/approach – Through the author's work with clients in industry, services and government, five key talent development principles are distilled, tested and evaluated. Findings – There are various, sometimes conflicting, ways to determine who is of value within an organisation. HR departments are unlikely to address talent management as an integrated process. The form and purpose of talent development efforts are frequently mismatched. Preferred learning styles and the design of talent programs are often at odds. Talents have the potential to be much more engaged in and meaningful to their organisation. Practical implications – Clarify what “talent” means in your organisation by formulating a crystal clear policy. Perceive talent management as an integrated process and start organising it as a coherent effort, involving all human resource departments. Fulfil a clear and present organisational need with your talent development efforts. Offer mentoring by true role models and thus enhance the talent's organisational “know‐how” and business insight and accelerate their development. Harness the power of the talent pool, because talents working in teams could offer your company a huge and largely untapped cognitive surplus. Originality/value – The five key principles of talent development and the 25 decisions will aid human resource professionals in assessing or designing their own talent, leadership and career development trajectories.},

First, are companies engaged in CSR communicating their CSR practices effectively in online recruitment advertising? And second, what CSR information should companies include in online job advertisements to improve their employer attractiveness to prospective candidates? The findings of this study show that CSR communication in recruitment advertising is often limited, an ad-hoc practice, and mostly focused on company practices concerning employee participation and development. Even companies with a great CSR reputation take surprisingly little advantage of their CSR image when it comes to attracting job candidates. To improve employer attractiveness, we recommend that human resources managers consider (1) optimizing the structure of online job advertisements by including a company overview section in which CSR information can be presented easily, (2) expanding the scope of CSR dimensions in job advertisements to include environmental performance and community relations, (3) offering information about opportunities for employee engagement with CSR, and (4) adopting a strategic approach to the inclusion of CSR content in online job advertisements.},

In 3 experiments, African American professionals were attuned to minority representation and diversity philosophy cues when they were presented as a part of workplace settings. Low minority representation cues coupled with colorblindness (as opposed to valuing diversity) led African American professionals to perceive threatening identity contingencies and to distrust the setting (Experiment 1). The authors then verified that the mechanism mediating the effect of setting cues on trust was identity contingent evaluations (Experiments 2 \& 3). The power of social identity contingencies as they relate to underrepresented groups in mainstream institutions is discussed.},

  abstract = {The wide spread use of online recruitment services has led to information explosion in the job market. As a result, the recruiters have to seek the intelligent ways for Person-Job Fit, which is the bridge for adapting the right job seekers to the right positions. Existing studies on Person-Job Fit have a focus on measuring the matching degree between the talent qualification and the job requirements mainly based on the manual inspection of human resource experts despite of the subjective, incomplete, and inefficient nature of the human judgement. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end A bility-aware P erson-J ob F it N eural N etwork (APJFNN) model, which has a goal of reducing the dependence on manual labour and can provide better interpretation about the fitting results. The key idea is to exploit the rich information available at abundant historical job application data. Specifically, we propose a word-level semantic representation for both job requirements and job seekers' experiences based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Along this line, four hierarchical ability-aware attention strategies are designed to measure the different importance of job requirements for semantic representation, as well as measuring the different contribution of each job experience to a specific ability requirement. Finally, extensive experiments on a large-scale real-world data set clearly validate the effectiveness and interpretability of the APJFNN framework compared with several baselines.},

The effectiveness of transfer learning has given rise to a diversity of approaches, methodology, and practice. In this paper, we explore the landscape of transfer learning techniques for NLP by introducing a unified framework that converts all text-based language problems into a text-to-text format. Our systematic study compares pre-training objectives, architectures, unlabeled data sets, transfer approaches, and other factors on dozens of language understanding tasks. By combining the insights from our exploration with scale and our new ``Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus'', we achieve state-of-the-art results on many benchmarks covering summarization, question answering, text classification, and more. To facilitate future work on transfer learning for NLP, we release our data set, pre-trained models, and code.},

In this work, we document and analyze the claims and practices of companies offering algorithms for employment assessment. In particular, we identify vendors of algorithmic pre-employment assessments (i.e., algorithms to screen candidates), document what they have disclosed about their development and validation procedures, and evaluate their practices, focusing particularly on efforts to detect and mitigate bias. Our analysis considers both technical and legal perspectives. Technically, we consider the various choices vendors make regarding data collection and prediction targets, and explore the risks and trade-offs that these choices pose. We also discuss how algorithmic de-biasing techniques interface with, and create challenges for, antidiscrimination law.},

However, these techniques/models are rather stand alone and are unable to provide an objective measure of the effectiveness of their approach leading to mismatch of skills. In this research study, we are proposing a Theoretical Hybrid Model, combining aspects of Artificial Intelligence and Game Based Assessment in profiling, assessing and ranking graduates based on their soft skills. Firstly, an Intelligent Controller is used to extract and classify the graduate skill profile based on data findings extracted using traditional assessment methods of self-evaluation and interview. With motivation and engagement as a competitive difference, an existing Game Based Assessment (OWIWI) is then used to assess the soft skills of these graduates hence generating a Graduate Profile based on results of the game. Moving forward, a ranking technique is then applied to match the profile to selected job requirements based on soft skills required for the job and the graduate strength. Finally, a comparison analysis is concluded based on the soft skills profile obtained before employment (pre-employment) and objective measure feedback of soft skills obtained after employment (post-employment) to provide a validity check to study the effectiveness of the overall Hybrid Model. Specifically, data obtained from this study can be useful in solving issues of unemployment due to mismatch of soft skills at the Higher Learning Institution level.},

Therefore, perceived importance of agentic versus communal traits for success in science may contribute to subtle gender biases in science. Perceptions of science faculty may be especially important to investigate due to their positions as role models, exemplars, and gatekeepers. The present study tested the hypothesis that agentic traits are considered more important for success in science than communal traits. Faculty (n=115) and undergraduate students (n=122) from science departments at large, research-intensive universities were surveyed using either an open- or closed-ended format, so as to gauge what traits come to mind as well as those possibly related to success in science. Both faculty and students, regardless of gender, perceived agentic traits as more important for success in science than communal traits. Additionally, there were no gender differences in self-perceptions of agentic traits, though women perceived themselves as more communal than men. Finally, participants' perceptions of their own traits correlated with those they perceived as necessary for success in science.},

The results indicated that biographical similarity of interviewer and applicant led to higher ratings of the candidate's job suitability and other personal characteristics.

It finds that sites emphasize cultural and economic uses of ICT, doing little to foster civic applications that could empower girls as citizens of the information age. The study also finds that sites foster a narrow range of ICT proficiencies, focusing mostly on areas such as communication, in which girls have already achieved parity with boys. An examination of the role models portrayed in ICT occupations indicates that the sites show females mainly in elite technology jobs, reversing stereotypical mass media depictions of females in low-status roles in relation to ICT. Employing an original index of ICT knowledge and skills, the study finds that the sites that scored highest both on fostering comprehensive knowledge and skills as well as featuring civic content were general interest Web communities. Ownership (for-profit or not-for-profit) of sites was less important than editorial control: Sites that offered girls a place to contribute their own content were more likely to offer civic material and a broader range of ICT knowledge and skills. We conclude with recommendations for Web site designers to rethink their design strategies and their rationales for closing the gender gap in computing.},

Facial analysis, one application of artificial intelligence, is increasingly used in real-word situations. For example, some organizations tell candidates to answer predefined questions in a recorded video and use facial recognition to analyze the potential applicant faces. In addition, some companies are developing facial recognition software to scan the faces in crowds and assess threats, specifically mentioning doubt and anger as emotions that indicate threats.  This study provides evidence that facial recognition software interprets emotions differently based on the person’s race. Using a publically available data set of professional basketball players’ pictures, I compare the emotional analysis from two different facial recognition services, Face   and Microsoft's Face API. Both services interpret black players as having more negative emotions than white players; however, there are two different mechanisms. Face   consistently interprets black players as angrier than white players, even controlling for their degree of smiling. Microsoft registers contempt instead of anger, and it interprets black players as more contemptuous when their facial expressions are ambiguous. As the players’ smile widens, the disparity disappears. This finding has implications for individuals, organizations, and society, and it contributes to the growing literature of bias and/or disparate impact in AI.},

In this article, the author provides an inside look into one type of diversity practice: diversity recruitment. Drawing on qualitative evidence from hiring in elite law firms, investment banks, and management consulting firms, the author analyzes what diversity recruitment looks like in these firms in theory and in practice. The author finds that although these firms tend to have the ingredients for success on paper, in practice the presence of structural and status divides between those responsible for overseeing diversity recruitment and those making hiring decisions, alongside widespread cultural beliefs among decision-makers that diversity is not a valid criterion of evaluation, stymies firms’ efforts to diversify. The author’s findings highlight that to be successful in translating diversity programs into results, those charged with overseeing diversity programs need not only formal organizational authority but also sufficient informal power and status to wield influence.},

  abstract = {This article presents culture as a vehicle of labor market sorting. Providing a case study of hiring in elite professional service firms, I investigate the often suggested but heretofore empirically unexamined hypothesis that cultural similarities between employers and job candidates matter for employers’ hiring decisions. Drawing from 120 interviews with employers as well as participant observation of a hiring committee, I argue that hiring is more than just a process of skills sorting; it is also a process of cultural matching between candidates, evaluators, and firms. Employers sought candidates who were not only competent but also culturally similar to themselves in terms of leisure pursuits, experiences, and self-presentation styles. Concerns about shared culture were highly salient to employers and often outweighed concerns about absolute productivity. I unpack the interpersonal processes through which cultural similarities affected candidate evaluation in elite firms and provide the first empirical demonstration that shared culture—particularly in the form of lifestyle markers—matters for employer hiring. I conclude by discussing the implications for scholarship on culture, inequality, and labor markets.},

  abstract = {Employers often struggle to assess qualified applicants, particularly in contexts where they receive hundreds of applications for job openings. In an effort to increase efficiency and improve the process, many have begun employing new tools to sift through these applications, looking for signals that a candidate is “the best fit.” Some companies use tools that offer algorithmic assessments of workforce data to identify the variables that lead to stronger employee performance, or to high employee attrition rates, while others turn to third party ranking services to identify the top applicants in a labor pool. Still others eschew automated systems, but rely heavily on publicly available data to assess candidates beyond their applications. For example, some HR managers turn to LinkedIn to determine if a candidate knows other employees or to identify additional information about them or their networks. Although most companies do not intentionally engage in discriminatory hiring practices (particularly on the basis of protected classes), their reliance on automated systems, algorithms, and existing networks systematically benefits some at the expense of others, often without employers even recognizing the biases of such mechanisms. The intersection of hiring practices and the Big Data phenomenon has not produced inherently new challenges. While this paper addresses issues of privacy, fairness, transparency, accuracy, and inequality under the rubric of discrimination, it does not pivot solely around the legal definitions of discrimination under current federal anti-discrimination law. Rather, it describes a number of areas where issues of inherent bias intersect with, or come into conflict with, socio-cultural notions of fairness.},

Consistent with previous research, older adults were shown to be underrepresented in the commercials examined, as compared to their presence in the population. This effect was particularly strong for older women and for members of ethnic minorities. However, older adults were found to be presented in a relatively positive light—as active, happy, and strong. In addition, older adults were shown to be least underrepresented in advertisements for financial services and retail chains, and most underrepresented in advertisements for automobiles and travel services. The results are discussed in terms of the changing position of the older adult consumer in the marketplace. Suggestions for future research are provided.},

This may create negative attitudes and lead to discrimination against persons of advanced age. Age-related stereotypes and prejudice can result in age discrimination, termed ageism. This research concerns the question of perceived ageism towards older people in 25 EU countries, surveyed in 2015 using the Special Eurobarometer 437. The analytical section includes descriptive findings and the results of three multi-level regression models addressing three domains (explained variables) of perceived ageism: 1) discrimination in general, 2) discrimination during economic crisis, and 3) discrimination when electing an older person as a high official. The two-level regression allowed simultaneous modelling of individual-level (gender, age, partnership status, social class, and life satisfaction) and of country-level (life expectancy at 55, perceived start of old age, and HDI) effects. The personal characteristics impacted much stronger perceived ageism than country contexts. Ageist perception in general has mostly been noted at pre-retirement age, but the age profile has not been the same across three regression models. The East-West gradient, frequently reported, is questioned because the geographical picture of perceived ageism is rather puzzling.},

  abstract = {Business recruiters generally report seeking to hire well-rounded students who have not only technical knowledge and skills, but also behavioral ones. However, business students appear to be somewhat skeptical of this claim. One reason for this skepticism may be students' attention to recruiter signals concerning the importance of behavioral knowledge and skills during the recruitment and selection process. In an attempt to determine whether the addition of significant behavioral coursework to a student's portfolio enhances recruiters' assessments of student employability, we conducted two studies using different methodologies. Results showed that when asked directly about their preferences (Study 1), a clear majority of recruiters (78\%) indicated that they preferred business graduates who supplemented functional-area (e.g., finance, accounting) coursework with equivalent amounts of behavioral coursework. However, when evaluating specific student resumes (Study 2), recruiters gave the same employability ratings to students who took only functional courses as to those who focused both on functional and behavioral courses. Our results are discussed in the context of growing evidence that behavioral science is regarded as a marginal topic both in business and in business education.},

  abstract = {Discriminatory practices in recruitment and hiring are an ongoing issue that is a concern not just for workplace relations, but also for wider understandings of economic justice and inequality. The ability to get and keep a job is a key aspect of participating in society and sustaining livelihoods. Yet the way decisions are made on who is eligible for jobs, and why, are rapidly changing with the advent and growth in uptake of automated hiring systems (AHSs) powered by data-driven tools. Evidence of the extent of this uptake around the globe is scarce, but a recent report estimated that 98\% of Fortune 500 companies use Applicant Tracking Systems of some kind in their hiring process, a trend driven by perceived efficiency measures and cost-savings. Key concerns about such AHSs include the lack of transparency and potential limitation of access to jobs for specific profiles. In relation to the latter, however, several of these AHSs claim to detect and mitigate discriminatory practices against protected groups and promote diversity and inclusion at work. Yet whilst these tools have a growing user-base around the world, such claims of 'bias mitigation' are rarely scrutinised and evaluated, and when done so, have almost exclusively been from a US socio-legal perspective. In this paper, we introduce a perspective outside the US by critically examining how three prominent automated hiring systems (AHSs) in regular use in the UK, HireVue, Pymetrics and Applied, understand and attempt to mitigate bias and discrimination. These systems have been chosen as they explicitly claim to address issues of discrimination in hiring and, unlike many of their competitors, provide some information about how their systems work that can inform an analysis. Using publicly available documents, we describe how their tools are designed, validated and audited for bias, highlighting assumptions and limitations, before situating these in the socio-legal context of the UK. The UK has a very different legal background to the US in terms not only of hiring and equality law, but also in terms of data protection (DP) law. We argue that this might be important for addressing concerns about transparency and could mean a challenge to building bias mitigation into AHSs definitively capable of meeting EU legal standards. This is significant as these AHSs, especially those developed in the US, may obscure rather than improve systemic discrimination in the workplace.},

Prevailing conceptual confusions can be observed due to ambiguities in the underlining concepts called “Talent” and “Talent Management”. Different global manufacturing and service industries are operating numerous talent management practices. There are two key objectives of this research, and the archival method was adopted by the researchers. The systematic reviewing process has covered empirical research on talent, talent management and talent management practices, which has been published between 1990 and 2019 in academic journals and published books. Based on the “objective approach” talent was defined as the multiplication of three main characteristics of people; competence, commitment and contribution. Based on the ‘subjective approach”, talent may be exclusive or inclusive or a combination of both. Thus, “Talent” was considered as an elite subset of the organization’s population or entire employees of an organization. Talent Management was defined as a collection of functions, practices and activities categorized into talent acquisition, talent development, talent retention, career management and succession management of talent pool and talent generically in implementing the business strategies in fruitful mode. It was identified that, the global manufacturing industries, namely cement manufacturing, steel case manufacturing, coal and mining industry, energy; automotive and service sectors, namely healthcare, hospitality, fast food service, banking, education, telecommunication and IT services are operating numerous talent management practices in attracting, acquiring, developing and retaining high performing talents. Talent acquisition, talent development, talent retention, career management and succession management are the key identified talent management practices in global contexts.},

  abstract = {Warning: this paper contains content that may be offensive or upsetting. Language has the power to reinforce stereotypes and project social biases onto others. At the core of the challenge is that it is rarely what is stated explicitly, but rather the implied meanings, that frame people's judgments about others. For example, given a statement that "we shouldn't lower our standards to hire more women," most listeners will infer the implicature intended by the speaker -- that "women (candidates) are less qualified." Most semantic formalisms, to date, do not capture such pragmatic implications in which people express social biases and power differentials in language. We introduce Social Bias Frames, a new conceptual formalism that aims to model the pragmatic frames in which people project social biases and stereotypes onto others. In addition, we introduce the Social Bias Inference Corpus to support large-scale modelling and evaluation with 150k structured annotations of social media posts, covering over 34k implications about a thousand demographic groups. We then establish baseline approaches that learn to recover Social Bias Frames from unstructured text. We find that while state-of-the-art neural models are effective at high-level categorization of whether a given statement projects unwanted social bias (80\% F1), they are not effective at spelling out more detailed explanations in terms of Social Bias Frames. Our study motivates future work that combines structured pragmatic inference with commonsense reasoning on social implications.},

  abstract = {Saturation has attained widespread acceptance as a methodological principle in qualitative research. It is commonly taken to indicate that, on the basis of the data that have been collected or analysed hitherto, further data collection and/or analysis are unnecessary. However, there appears to be uncertainty as to how saturation should be conceptualized, and inconsistencies in its use. In this paper, we look to clarify the nature, purposes and uses of saturation, and in doing so add to theoretical debate on the role of saturation across different methodologies. We identify four distinct approaches to saturation, which differ in terms of the extent to which an inductive or a deductive logic is adopted, and the relative emphasis on data collection, data analysis, and theorizing. We explore the purposes saturation might serve in relation to these different approaches, and the implications for how and when saturation will be sought. In examining these issues, we highlight the uncertain logic underlying saturation—as essentially a predictive statement about the unobserved based on the observed, a judgement that, we argue, results in equivocation, and may in part explain the confusion surrounding its use. We conclude that saturation should be operationalized in a way that is consistent with the research question(s), and the theoretical position and analytic framework adopted, but also that there should be some limit to its scope, so as not to risk saturation losing its coherence and potency if its conceptualization and uses are stretched too widely.},

We make no value judgment regarding this devel- opment; rather, we simply acknowledge that it is quickly becoming reality that automation plays a role in hiring. Increasingly, these technologies are used in all of the small decisions that make up the modern hiring pipeline: from which resumes get selected for a first screen to who gets an on site interview. Thus, these algo- rithms and models may potentially amplify bias and (un)fairness issues for many historically marginalized groups. While there is a rapidly expanding literature on algorithmic decision making and fairness, there has been limited work on fairness specifically for online, multi-stakeholder decision making processes such as those found in hiring. We outline broad challenges including formulat- ing definitions for fair treatment and fair outcomes in hiring, and incorporating these definitions into the algorithms and processes that constitute the modern hiring pipeline. We see the AAMAS community as uniquely positioned to address these challenges.},

However, past research suggests that machine learning systems often produce biased output. In this article, we evaluate potential gender biases of commercial image recognition platforms using photographs of U.S. members of Congress and a large number of Twitter images posted by these politicians. Our crowdsourced validation shows that commercial image recognition systems can produce labels that are correct and biased at the same time as they selectively report a subset of many possible true labels. We find that images of women received three times more annotations related to physical appearance. Moreover, women in images are recognized at substantially lower rates in comparison with men. We discuss how encoded biases such as these affect the visibility of women, reinforce harmful gender stereotypes, and limit the validity of the insights that can be gathered from such data.},

Regarding the weighting process, we found that PO fit was weighted more heavily for a permanent position, and PJ fit for a fixed-term and/or a knowledge-intensive position. In addition, the position’s contract duration (permanent vs. fixed-term) and task elements (managerial vs. knowledge-intensive) interacted in influencing the weighting of PO fit and PJ fit.},

However, stereotype threat seems to mean different things to different researchers and has been employed to describe and explain processes and phenomena that appear to be fundamentally distinct. Complementing existing models, the authors posit a Multi-Threat Framework in which six qualitatively distinct stereotype threats arise from the intersection of two dimensions-the target of the threat (the self/one's group) and the source of the threat (the self/outgroup others/ingroup others). The authors propose that these threats constitute the core of the broader stereotype threat construct and provide the foundation for understanding additional, as of yet uncharacterized, stereotype threats. The proposed threats likely differentially peril those with different stigmatizable characteristics, have different eliciting conditions and moderators, are mediated by somewhat different processes, are coped with and compensated for in different ways, and require different interventions to overcome. © 2007 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.},

  abstract = {The nature of technologies that are recognised as Artificial Intelligence (AI) has continually changed over time to be something more advanced than other technologies. Despite the fluidity of understanding of AI, the most common theme that has stuck with AI is ‘human-like decision making’. Advancements in processing power, coupled with big data technologies, gave rise to highly accurate prediction algorithms. Analytical techniques which use multi-layered neural networks such as machine learning and deep learning have emerged as the drivers of these AI-based applications. Due to easy access and growing information workforce, these algorithms are extensively used in a plethora of industries ranging from healthcare, transportation, finance, legal systems, to even military. AI-tools have the potential to transform industries and societies through automation. Conversely, the undesirable or negative consequences of AI-tools have harmed their respective organisations in social, financial and legal spheres. As the use of these algorithms propagates in the industry, the AI-based decisions have the potential to affect large portions of the population, sometimes involving vulnerable groups in society. This chapter presents an overview of AI’s use in organisations by discussing the following: first, it discusses the core components of AI. Second, the chapter discusses common goals organisations can achieve with AI. Third, it examines different types of AI. Fourth, it discusses unintended consequences that may take place in organisations due to the use of AI. Fifth, it discusses vulnerabilities that may arise from AI systems. Lastly, this chapter offers some recommendations for industries to consider regarding the development and implementation of AI systems.},

  abstract = {At LinkedIn, we want to create economic opportunity for everyone in the global workforce. To make this happen, LinkedIn offers a reactive Job Search system, and a proactive Jobs You May Be Interested In (JYMBII) system to match the best candidates with their dream jobs. One of the most challenging tasks for developing these systems is to properly extract important skill entities from job postings and then target members with matched attributes. In this work, we show that the commonly used text-based \textbackslash emph\{salience and market-agnostic\} skill extraction approach is sub-optimal because it only considers skill mention and ignores the salient level of a skill and its market dynamics, i.e., the market supply and demand influence on the importance of skills. To address the above drawbacks, we present \textbackslash model, our deployed \textbackslash emph\{salience and market-aware\} skill extraction system. The proposed \textbackslash model \textasciitilde shows promising results in improving the online performance of job recommendation (JYMBII) (\$+1.92\textbackslash\%\$ job apply) and skill suggestions for job posters (\$-37\textbackslash\%\$ suggestion rejection rate). Lastly, we present case studies to show interesting insights that contrast traditional skill recognition method and the proposed \textbackslash model\textasciitilde from occupation, industry, country, and individual skill levels. Based on the above promising results, we deployed the \textbackslash model \textasciitilde online to extract job targeting skills for all \$20\$M job postings served at LinkedIn.},

As a result, most major organizations have recognized the need for and outlined a formal process to identify and assess high-potential talent. There is, however, little agreement within or between organizations on the definition and components of the concept of potential. The existing definitions and models of potential are often narrowly focused on only a few select factors and give little attention to the broad spectrum of potential talent in an organization. This article introduces a new integrated model of potential that incorporates previous literature and current assessment practice regarding high potentials, provides a coherent structure of potential, and is reflective of a variety of different talent pools. The model provides a useful method for answering the key question—Potential for what? Three key components of potential are described by the model: (a) foundational dimensions, (b) growth dimensions, and (c) career dimensions. Implications for assisting organizations in more effectively managing their high potential talent for strategic business objectives are discussed.},

First, we show that despite empirical psychologists? nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.},

  abstract = {With the exponential increase in the amount of digital information over the internet, online shops, online music, video and image libraries, search engines and recommendation system have become the most convenient ways to find relevant information within a short time. In the recent times, deep learning's advances have gained significant attention in the field of speech recognition, image processing and natural language processing. Meanwhile, several recent studies have shown the utility of deep learning in the area of recommendation systems and information retrieval as well. In this short review, we cover the recent advances made in the field of recommendation using various variants of deep learning technology. We organize the review in three parts: Collaborative system, Content based system and Hybrid system. The review also discusses the contribution of deep learning integrated recommendation systems into several application domains. The review concludes by discussion of the impact of deep learning in recommendation system in various domain and whether deep learning has shown any significant improvement over the conventional systems for recommendation. Finally, we also provide future directions of research which are possible based on the current state of use of deep learning in recommendation systems.},

Results revealed: (1) greater essentialism among men than women; (2) greater essentialism of masculine (vs. feminine) concepts, and; (3) for men, greater essentialism among those who report greater conformity to masculine norms.

  abstract = {In the workplace, women often encounter gender stereotypes and biases that reinforce the existing gender hierarchy, may hinder women’s career aspirations and retention, and may limit their ability to be promoted—especially in traditionally male organizations. Long-standing and widely held (although often unconscious) beliefs about gender can reinforce women’s perceived lower status position relative to men’s. Because men are described/prescribed as agentic (often masculine) and women as communal (often feminine), women leaders are often evaluated as being status-incongruent. We explore the gendered assignment of leader attributes with particular attention to associations of agentic competence (deficiency for women) and agentic dominance (penalty for women). We examined peer evaluations of 4344~U.S. Naval Academy students who are assigned attributes from a predefined list. Although men and women received similar numbers of descriptive (positive) attributes, women received more proscriptive (negative) attributes than did men and these individual attributes were predominantly feminine. These findings offer evidence that women leaders’ status incongruity may be associated with perceived competence (agentic deficiency). A contribution of our analysis is theory testing using data from a real-life performance evaluation system. Additionally, our research contributes to our knowledge of gendered language and status characteristics in performance evaluations and can assist researchers and practitioners with developing interventions. Understanding the association of gender status beliefs with evaluation processes may facilitate changing workplace culture to be more gender-inclusive through less biased and stereotypical performance evaluations.},

First, we introduce the basic principles of logistic regression analysis (conditional probability, logit transformation, odds ratio). Second, we discuss the two fundamental implications of running this kind of analysis with a nested data structure: In multilevel logistic regression, the odds that the outcome variable equals one (rather than zero) may vary from one cluster to another (i.e. the intercept may vary) and the effect of a lower-level variable may also vary from one cluster to another (i.e. the slope may vary). Third and finally, we provide a simplified three-step “turnkey” procedure for multilevel logistic regression modeling: ~ -Preliminary phase: Cluster- or grand-mean centering variables -Step \#1: Running an empty model and calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) -Step \#2: Running a constrained and an augmented intermediate model and performing a likelihood ratio test to determine whether considering the cluster-based variation of the effect of the lower-level variable improves the model fit -Step \#3 Running a final model and interpreting the odds ratio and confidence intervals to determine whether data support your hypothesis ~ Command syntax for Stata, R, Mplus, and SPSS are included. These steps will be applied to a study on Justin Bieber, because everybody likes Justin Bieber.1},

Data processing often involves choices among several reasonable options for excluding, transforming, and coding data. We suggest that instead of performing only one analysis, researchers could perform a multiverse analysis, which involves performing all analyses across the whole set of alternatively processed data sets corresponding to a large set of reasonable scenarios. Using an example focusing on the effect of fertility on religiosity and political attitudes, we show that analyzing a single data set can be misleading and propose a multiverse analysis as an alternative practice. A multiverse analysis offers an idea of how much the conclusions change because of arbitrary choices in data construction and gives pointers as to which choices are most consequential in the fragility of the result.},

Research shows that this threat dramatically depresses the standardized test performance of women and African Americans who are in the academic vanguard of their groups (offering a new interpretation of group differences in standardized test performance), that it causes disidentification with school, and that practices that reduce this threat can reduce these negative effects.},

Design/methodology/approach – An exploratory study of one organisation at a very early stage of implementing TM which involved some documentary analysis and interviews with six senior HR professionals in the organisation. Findings – There is some limited evidence that professionals view different aspects of HR practice in isolation and do not make connections in practice as well as they could. This evidence is taken as sufficient support for the need for more research into the proposition. Research limitations/implications – The paper is in its early stages and findings are not argued to be generalisable. However, they are sufficient to suggest there will be value on further research on connections between TM and managing diversity. One area still to be explored in more depth is the role of human resource development (HRD) practice in making those connections. Practical implications – Both academics and practitioners may have to consider less emphasis on narrow speciaisms and foci in their work and take on more wholistic perspectives. Originality/value – The literature review confirmed the assumption that the two topics are researched and written about separately with little published on the connections and implications of each for the other.},

It assesses the extent to which the ‘gendered’ vocabulary used in job advertisements can potentially influence the decision-making of women and men seeking secondary school PE teaching posts in England and the implications for professional practice. Discussions with 32 postgraduate trainee teachers were carried out at a teacher training institution in the south of England and focused on their perceptions of 30 job advertisements for PE teachers. The data showed that male and female trainees often felt that employment opportunities for men and women in PE were constrained by the ‘gendered’ vocabulary included within advertisements and therefore had some impact on their decisions when considering whether to apply for particular posts. Given the dominance of sex-differentiated patterns of staffing within PE in the United Kingdom, the study raises questions related to employment rights of women and men and assesses the extent to which vocabulary can deter or prevent potential applicants from applying for particular teaching posts based on their sex. Likewise, this study considers whether PE job advertisements, particularly for senior PE management positions, can be justified on the grounds of sex within the framework of equal opportunities.},

Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a survey to collect professionals´ (mostly recruiters´) ratings of preselected occupations. Participants were asked to rate warmth and competence attributes. Factor and cluster analysis were employed to investigate the two-dimensional structure of the warmth/competence space and how and whether occupations cluster as predicted by the stereotype content model (SCM). Findings Almost all occupations showed a clear two-factorial structure, corresponding to the warmth/competence dimensions. A five-cluster solution was deemed appropriate as depicting how occupations disperse on these dimensions. Implications for stereotyping research, the design of hiring discrimination experiments, and HRM are discussed. Originality/value In contrast to previous related research, in which participants select the included occupations themselves, the authors included prespecified common occupations, which should be important for representativeness. In addition, previous research has been conducted in the United States, while the authors conduct this study in a European context (Sweden). Finally, instead of studying students or participants with unspecified work experience, the authors focus on professionals (mostly recruiters).},

Based on the broad range of application possibilities, the current paper aims to explore the possible future application and consequences of the IoT in HRM by conducting an explorative Delphi-study with 40 IoT-experts. The results of the study reveal the application of the IoT in HRM to be perceived as a likely development in the near future. The results also uncover various consequences of the IoT in HRM. The expected adoption of the IoT in HRM will first change HR technologies, i.e. the hardware, software and data of HRM. Second, the changes also involve larger modifications of HR activities. However, these activities are affected in different intensities. Third, the application of the IoT is also expected to noticeably change tasks and qualifications of HR actors. In summary, the current study indicates that smart HRM will constitute both a likely and relevant future development that needs deeper consideration.},

VL-BERT adopts the simple yet powerful Transformer model as the backbone, and extends it to take both visual and linguistic embedded features as input. In it, each element of the input is either of a word from the input sentence, or a region-of-interest (RoI) from the input image. It is designed to fit for most of the visual-linguistic downstream tasks. To better exploit the generic representation, we pre-train VL-BERT on the massive-scale Conceptual Captions dataset, together with text-only corpus. Extensive empirical analysis demonstrates that the pre-training procedure can better align the visual-linguistic clues and benefit the downstream tasks, such as visual commonsense reasoning, visual question answering and referring expression comprehension. It is worth noting that VL-BERT achieved the first place of single model on the leaderboard of the VCR benchmark. Code is released at \textbackslash url\{https://github.com/jackroos/VL-BERT\}.},

Drawing on media richness theory and social interface theory, this study employed a novel experimental design to compare human ratings and job applicants' response behaviours between the SVI and AVI settings and compare job applicants’ fairness perception between the AVI setting and the AVI setting using an AI decision agent (AVI-AI). The results from 180 observations revealed that 1) first impression and physical appearance significantly affected structured interview ratings regardless of whether the video interview was synchronous; 2) compared with SVIs, AVIs lessened the primacy effect on physical appearance and initial impression among human raters; 3) job applicants had indistinguishable fairness perceptions regarding synchrony (SVI vs. AVI) and decision agent (human vs. AI); and 4) applicants exhibited less favourability towards AVIs than towards SVIs. Findings from this experimental comparison, including recommendations for practice and future research on human resource selection, technology education, and social computing, are discussed.},

Results indicated gender differences consistent with gender stereotypes when men and women were interacting with same-sex friends; men with men were more dominant and women with women were more agreeable. In interactions with romantic partners, gender differences in communal behavior were opposite to gender stereotypes; women were less agreeable and more quarrelsome than men with their romantic partners.

Due to computational constraints, existing analyses are mostly conducted on publicly-released LM checkpoints, which makes it difficult to study how various factors during training affect the models' acquisition of linguistic knowledge. In this paper, we train a suite of small-scale Transformer LMs that differ from each other with respect to architectural decisions (e.g., self-attention configuration) or training objectives (e.g., multi-tasking, focal loss). We evaluate these LMs on BLiMP, a targeted evaluation benchmark of multiple English linguistic phenomena. Our experiments show that while none of these modifications yields significant improvements on aggregate, changes to the loss function result in promising improvements on several subcategories (e.g., detecting adjunct islands, correctly scoping negative polarity items). We hope our work offers useful insights for future research into designing Transformer LMs that more effectively learn linguistic knowledge.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, machine learning algorithms relied on reliable labels from experts to build predictions. More recently however, algorithms have been receiving data from the general population in the form of labeling, annotations, etc. The result is that algorithms are subject to bias that is born from ingesting unchecked information, such as biased samples and biased labels. Furthermore, people and algorithms are increasingly engaged in interactive processes wherein neither the human nor the algorithms receive unbiased data. Algorithms can also make biased predictions, leading to what is now known as algorithmic bias. On the other hand, human’s reaction to the output of machine learning methods with algorithmic bias worsen the situations by making decision based on biased information, which will probably be consumed by algorithms later. Some recent research has focused on the ethical and moral implication of machine learning algorithmic bias on society. However, most research has so far treated algorithmic bias as a static factor, which fails to capture the dynamic and iterative properties of bias. We argue that algorithmic bias interacts with humans in an iterative manner, which has a long-term effect on algorithms’ performance. For this purpose, we present an iterated-learning framework that is inspired from human language evolution to study the interaction between machine learning algorithms and humans. Our goal is to study two sources of bias that interact: the process by which people select information to label (human action); and the process by which an algorithm selects the subset of information to present to people (iterated algorithmic bias mode). We investigate three forms of iterated algorithmic bias (personalization filter, active learning, and random) and how they affect the performance of machine learning algorithms by formulating research questions about the impact of each type of bias. Based on statistical analyses of the results of several controlled experiments, we found that the three different iterated bias modes, as well as initial training data class imbalance and human action, do affect the models learned by machine learning algorithms. We also found that iterated filter bias, which is prominent in personalized user interfaces, can lead to more inequality in estimated relevance and to a limited human ability to discover relevant data. Our findings indicate that the relevance blind spot (items from the testing set whose predicted relevance probability is less than 0.5 and who thus risk being hidden from humans) amounted to 4\% of all relevant items when using a content-based filter that predicts relevant items. A similar simulation using a real-life rating data set found that the same filter resulted in a blind spot size of 75\% of the relevant testing set.},

  abstract = {Unsupervised text embedding methods, such as Skip-gram and Paragraph Vector, have been attracting increasing attention due to their simplicity, scalability, and effectiveness. However, comparing to sophisticated deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks, these methods usually yield inferior results when applied to particular machine learning tasks. One possible reason is that these text embedding methods learn the representation of text in a fully unsupervised way, without leveraging the labeled information available for the task. Although the low dimensional representations learned are applicable to many different tasks, they are not particularly tuned for any task. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing a semi-supervised representation learning method for text data, which we call the \textbackslash textit\{predictive text embedding\} (PTE). Predictive text embedding utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data to learn the embedding of text. The labeled information and different levels of word co-occurrence information are first represented as a large-scale heterogeneous text network, which is then embedded into a low dimensional space through a principled and efficient algorithm. This low dimensional embedding not only preserves the semantic closeness of words and documents, but also has a strong predictive power for the particular task. Compared to recent supervised approaches based on convolutional neural networks, predictive text embedding is comparable or more effective, much more efficient, and has fewer parameters to tune.},

That has less or more influenced the Information Technology students in determining the future job that is right for them. Based on this painful problem, we decided to build an application called SmartCV, which uses Smart Contract in Blockchain Technology to find jobs and connect with company recruiters for Information Technology students in Vietnam and the region. At the same time, we implemented a recommendation system using Machine Learning and Statistical Analysis algorithms to help them choose a suitable job based on their skills. Machine Learning algorithms included Feed Forward Neural Network (FNN), Sequential (KNF), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Statistical Analysis algorithm included Logistic Regression (LR) using the Python programming language. This recommendation system was trained and tested using a dataset of IT jobs crawled on job search websites. We evaluated machine learning algorithms using accuracy, recall, precision, and micro-F1 to predict the most suitable job. The experimental results of predicting students' jobs demonstrate that the Convolutional Neural Network Model (CNN) gives the highest accuracy.},

  abstract = {Algorithms increasingly automate or support managerial functions in organizations, with implications for the employee-employer relationship. We explored how algorithmic management affects this relationship with a focus on psychological contracts, or employees' perceptions of their own and their employers' obligations. Through five online experiments, we investigated how organizational agent type—algorithmic versus human—influenced one's psychological contract depending on the organizational inducement type—transactional versus relational. We explored psychological contracts in two stages of employment: during early phases, such as recruiting (Studies 1 and 2) and onboarding (Studies 4 and 5), when the agent explains the inducements to the employee; and during employment, when the agent under-delivers the inducements to varying degrees (Studies 3–5). Our results suggest that agent type did not affect psychological contracts around transactional inducements but did so for relational inducements in the cases of recruiting and low inducement delivery (Studies 1–5). Algorithmic agents signaled reduced employer commitments to relational inducements during recruiting (Study 1). Using human agents resulted in greater perceived breach when delivery of relational inducements was low (Study 5). Regardless of inducement type, turnover intentions were higher when the human agent under-delivered compared to the algorithmic agent (Study 5). Our studies show how algorithmic management may influence one's psychological contract.},

Social identity theory focuses on how group memberships guide intergroup behavior and influence an individual's self-concept. Closely tied to self-categorization is an individual's evaluation of the in-group. To reach positive evaluations of one's own in-group, people engage in processes of social comparison. They derogate the out-group with the aim of increasing their own self-esteem. Self-categorization theory proposes that, depending on salience in a situation, either personal identity and interpersonal behavior, social identity and intergroup behavior, or dynamic interplay prevails. These theories have widely been used to explain media use and media effects on people. For example, it has been shown that media users prefer media featuring positively portrayed protagonists of their own in-group.},

The online version has been corrected.] People are capable of thinking about the future, the past, remote locations, another person’s perspective, and counterfactual alternatives. Without denying the uniqueness of each process, it is proposed that they constitute different forms of traversing psychological distance. Psychological distance is egocentric: Its reference point is the self in the here and now, and the different ways in which an object might be removed from that point—in time, in space, in social distance, and in hypotheticality—constitute different distance dimensions. Transcending the self in the here and now entails mental construal, and the farther removed an object is from direct experience, the higher (more abstract) the level of construal of that object. Supporting this analysis, research shows (a) that the various distances are cognitively related to each other, (b) that they similarly influence and are influenced by level of mental construal, and (c) that they similarly affect prediction, preference, and action.

However, its performance depends not only on its features but also on data preprocessing and model tuning. The main purpose of this paper is to compare the efficiency of more Support Vector Machine models using both TF-IDF approach and Word2Vec and Doc2Vec neural networks for text data representation. Besides the data vectorization process, I try to enhance the models’ efficiency by identifying which kind of kernel fits better the data or if it is just better to opt for the linear case. My results prove that for the “Reuters 21578” dataset, nonlinear Support Vector Machine is more efficient when the conversion of text data into numerical attributes is realized using Word2Vec models instead of TF-IDF and Doc2Vec representations. When it is considered that data meet linear separability requirements, TF-IDF representation outperforms all other options. Surprisingly, Doc2Vec models have the lowest performance and only in terms of computational cost they provide satisfactory results. This paper proves that while Word2Vec models are truly efficient for text data representation, Doc2Vec neural networks are unable to exceed even TF-IDF index representation. This evidence},

Much of this work draws on the research from the excellent study and book called The War for Talent. In this paper, the author proposes that victory (from any war) does not come from talent alone, but from the organization. Organization is defined as capabilities, or what an organization is known for and good at, and culture, which is a key capability. When HR professionals deliver both talent and organization, they build sustainable success that leads to victory. Design/methodology/approach This paper offers a perspective on shifting HR focus from an exclusive emphasis on talent to one on talent and organization. The author gives many examples of where great individual talent does not lead to long-term success (e.g. in most team sports, the leading scorer is on the winning team about 20 per cent of the time). Findings Once one identifies organization as a source of long-term success, it is critical to operationalize organization into a series of conscious choices. The paper defines culture as a key capability (along with other possible capabilities of speed [agility, flexibility, responsiveness and change], innovation, collaboration, efficiency and so forth). The author identifies specific wars that HR professionals and line managers can diagnose that create the right organization. Originality/value Many have talked about parts of organization (culture, climate, systems, process, etc.). The author offers an original way to define organization capabilities and culture.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Traditional recruitment system relied heavily on the applicants’ curriculum vitae (CV). This system, besides becoming redundant, has proved to be a futile exercise leading to the hiring of candidates that eventually turn out to be ‘misfits’. CVs were the only source of candidates’ data available for the recruiters a few years back. Face-to-face interviews was considered to be the ultimate solution for hiring suitable candidates. However, evidence suggests that interview scores and job performances do not complement each other. Advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced several techniques in the recruitment process.Purpose: This chapter underscores the drawbacks of the traditional recruitment process. Evidence suggests that the traditional recruitment process is prone to subjectivity and is time-consuming. Surprisingly, despite the disadvantages, the integration of AI into the recruitment process is still slow. This chapter highlights the need to harness AI and the advantage technology could bring to the recruitment process. Some of the techniques that are garnering attention and widely used by organisations, such as chatbots, gamification, virtual employment interviews, and resume screening are described to enable the readers to understand with less effort. Chatbots and gamification techniques are described through process flow charts. We also describe the various types of interviews that could be conducted through virtual platforms and the modality by which the resume screening technique operates. Today, we are at a juncture wherein it is pertinent to acknowledge the superiority of technology-driven processes over traditional ones. This chapter will help the readers to understand the modus operandi to implement chatbots, gamification, virtual interviews and online resume screening techniques besides their advantages.Scope: Although chatbots, resume screening, virtual interviews, and gamification are used in other areas, too, such as training and development, marketing, etc., in this chapter, we restrict solely to employee recruitment processes.Methodology: Scoping review is used to examine the existing literature from various databases such as Google Scholar, IEEE, Proquest, Emerald, Elsevier, and JSTOR databases are used for extracting relevant articles.Findings: Automation and analytics in recruitment and selection remove bias which is otherwise increasingly found in manual hiring processes. Also, previous studies have observed that candidates engage in impression management tactics in traditional face-to-face interviews. However, through automated recruitment processes, the influence of these tactics can be eliminated. AI-based virtual interviews reduce human bias. It also helps recruiters to hire talents across the globe. Gamification improves the candidate’s perception of the work and work environments. Through gamified techniques, the recruiters can understand whether a candidate possesses the required job skills. Chatbots are an interactive technique that can respond to interviewees’ queries. Resume screening techniques can save the recruiter’s time by screening and selecting the most appropriate candidates from a large pool. Hence, the chosen candidates alone can be referred to the next stage of the recruitment cycle. AI improves the efficiency of the recruitment process. It reduces mundane tasks. It saves time for the human resources (HR) team.},

Our research finds that attitudes toward AI use in the job application process in general, and attitudes toward organizations that use AI in the job application process in particular, are strongly related to the intent of prospective employees to apply for jobs at those organizations that have AI-enabled job application processes. Given the growing use of AI technology and tools in candidate recruitment, and given that organizations primarily select from and offer jobs to those who have completed the job application process, a better understanding of what influences candidates’ reactions to AI-enabled recruiting could provide valuable insights into how organizations can more effectively manage those activities.},

In this study we present evidence based on data from Dutch employers and employees. Productivity perceptions are affected by one's age and one's position in the hierarchy. The young favor the young, the old favor the old, and employers value the productivity of workers less than employees do. However, there are also remarkable similarities across employers and employees. By distinguishing the various dimensions that underlie the productivity of younger and older workers, we tested whether soft qualities and abilities—e.g., reliability and commitment—are just as important as hard qualities—cognitive and physically based skills—in the eyes of both employers and employees. It appears that both employers and employees, young and old, view hard skills as far more important than soft skills.},

However, the current guidelines for preregistration have been developed primarily for studies where new data will be collected. Yet, preregistering secondary data analyses---where new analyses are proposed for existing data---is just as important, given that researchers’ hypotheses and analyses may be biased by their prior knowledge of the data. The need for proper guidance in this area is especially desirable now that data is increasingly shared publicly. In this tutorial, we present a template specifically designed for the preregistration of secondary data analyses and provide comments and a worked example that may help with using the template effectively. Through this illustration, we show that completing such a template is feasible, helps limit researcher degrees of freedom, and may make researchers more deliberate in their data selection and analysis efforts.},

This is an ethical problem because consumers need to know when they are exposed to advertising so they can raise counterarguments. To enhance transparency, guidelines have been issued that prescribe sponsorship disclosures. However, the actual use of these disclosures is limited and inconsistent. To better understand this ethical practice, the aim of the present qualitative interview study is to provide an overview of practitioners’ considerations to use disclosures (or not) for online sponsored content. We conducted a qualitative interview study, in which we interviewed 18 practitioners representing four stakeholder groups. The study reveals a diverse, complex, and conflicting set of considerations categorized as follows: moral responsibility toward consumers, own business interests, and perceptions regarding disclosure guidelines. We interpret our findings in light of previous studies in which advertising professionals talked about ethics. Implications for research and practice are discussed.},

Next, three approaches used to study women's employment are discussed: 1. the macro-level approach, which gives a thorough understanding of the influence of the institutional context on women's work; 2. the micro-level approach, which compares individual-level results in a number of countries; and 3. the macro-micro approach, in which the relative importance is shown of institutional and individual level factors. Finally, a review is given of the hypotheses and outcomes of both the institutional level, with welfare regime and family policy playing an important role, and the individual level, which shows that being a mother has an important effect on women's employment in the different countries studied.},

We explain these principles in more depth by critically reflecting on the way in which they were applied in two interview studies among viewers of current affairs programs and French chefs, respectively. An important objective of this chapter is to not only point to the benefits of interview research, or how to conduct interviews, but to also draw awareness to possible pitfalls, problems of validity and generalizability. Particularly in situations in which interviews must serve as input for policy research and advice, it is important that the policy researcher is well aware of both the opportunities and the limitations of interview research. A challenge for researchers that wish to use the insights from interviews is, therefore, to find ways of translating the insights from interviews into the language and logic of law and policy.},

The mixed beliefs about older workers resonate with the stereotype of older people in society according to the Stereotype Content Model (SCM) of being warm but less competent and are reflected in news and corporate media. The present study contributes by approaching stereotypes about older workers’ employability from a communication perspective. The study examines which requirements are communicated by employers in job advertisements targeting older job seekers, compared to those in job advertisements targeting general job seekers. This is done by using automated content analysis to inductively identify prominently advertised requirements, and to examine how these align with the older workers’ stereotype. Additionally, interviews with recruitment experts are conducted to provide explanation and interpretation. Findings reveal that the persistent idea about older workers performing well on so-called soft abilities and poorer on so-called hard abilities is reflected in job advertisements targeting older job seekers, as these represent requirements related to hard abilities to a lesser extent, whereas abilities related to customer service are more often requested. The mixed beliefs about older workers are reflected in the expert perspective of recruiters too, although with some optimism that older workers’ soft abilities fit well with employers’ need for a social and responsible workforce. The study contributes to insights regarding the SCM and framing theory.},

  abstract = {The present research develops and tests a theoretical extension of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) that explains perceived usefulness and usage intentions in terms of social influence and cognitive instrumental processes. The extended model, referred to as TAM2, was tested using longitudinal data collected regarding four different systems at four organizations (N = 156), two involving voluntary usage and two involving mandatory usage. Model constructs were measured at three points in time at each organization: preimplementation, one month postimplementation, and three months postimplementation. The extended model was strongly supported for all four organizations at all three points of measurement, accounting for 40\%–60\% of the variance in usefulness perceptions and 34\%–52\% of the variance in usage intentions. Both social influence processes (subjective norm, voluntariness, and image) and cognitive instrumental processes (job relevance, output quality, result demonstrability, and perceived ease of use) significantly influenced user acceptance. These findings advance theory and contribute to the foundation for future research aimed at improving our understanding of user adoption behavior.},

  abstract = {Prior research has provided valuable insights into how and why employees make a decision about the adoption and use of information technologies (ITs) in the workplace. From an organizational point of view, however, the more important issue is how managers make informed decisions about interventions that can lead to greater acceptance and effective utilization of IT. There is limited research in the IT implementation literature that deals with the role of interventions to aid such managerial decision making. Particularly, there is a need to understand how various interventions can influence the known determinants of IT adoption and use. To address this gap in the literature, we draw from the vast body of research on the technology acceptance model (TAM), particularly the work on the determinants of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, and: (i) develop a comprehensive nomological network (integrated model) of the determinants of individual level (IT) adoption and use; (ii) empirically test the proposed integrated model; and (iii) present a research agenda focused on potential pre- and postimplementation interventions that can enhance employees' adoption and use of IT. Our findings and research agenda have important implications for managerial decision making on IT implementation in organizations.},

Large language models are now the standard to develop state-of-the-art solutions for text detection and classification tasks. However, the development of advanced computational techniques and resources is disproportionately focused on the English language, sidelining a majority of the languages spoken globally. While existing research has developed better multilingual and monolingual language models to bridge this language disparity between English and non-English languages, we explore the promise of incorporating the information contained in images via multimodal machine learning. Our comparative analyses on three detection tasks focusing on crisis information, fake news, and emotion recognition, as well as five high-resource non-English languages, demonstrate that: (a) detection frameworks based on pre-trained large language models like BERT and multilingual-BERT systematically perform better on the English language compared against non-English languages, and (b) including images via multimodal learning bridges this performance gap. We situate our findings with respect to existing work on the pitfalls of large language models, and discuss their theoretical and practical implications.},

  abstract = {Modern interactions with technology are increasingly moving away from simple human use of computers as tools to the establishment of human relationships with autonomous entities that carry out actions on our behalf. In a recent commentary, Peter Hancock issued a stark warning to the field of human factors that attention must be focused on the appropriate design of a new class of technology: highly autonomous systems. In this article, we heed the warning and propose a human-centred approach directly aimed at ensuring that future human–autonomy interactions remain focused on the user’s needs and preferences. By adapting literature from industrial psychology, we propose a framework to infuse a unique human-like ability, building and actively repairing trust, into autonomous systems. We conclude by proposing a model to guide the design of future autonomy and a research agenda to explore current challenges in repairing trust between humans and autonomous systems.Practitioner Summary: This paper is a call to practitioners to re-cast our connection to technology as akin to a relationship between two humans rather than between a human and their tools. To that end, designing autonomy with trust repair abilities will ensure future technology maintains and repairs relationships with their human partners.},

The results of Studies 1 and 2 suggest that social comparisons with men are associated with feelings of stereotype threat whereas social comparisons with women are not. Stereotype threat, in turn, was associated with conflict surrounding women's identity as female employees and with decreased perceived likelihood of achieving career goals. Study 3 extended these findings by demonstrating that feelings of stereotype threat are also negatively related to workplace attitudes and turnover intentions. Furthermore, the effect of stereotype threat on these job attitudes and intentions was itself mediated by identity conflict and perceived likelihood of achieving career goals. Implications and limitations of these findings are discussed. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

As there are always numerous flexibilities in data-analytic decisions (a “garden of forking paths”), this poses perennial problems to all empirical research. Specification-curve analysis and multiverse analysis have recently been proposed as solutions to these issues. Building on the structural analogies between primary data analysis and meta-analysis, we transform and adapt these approaches to the meta-analytic level, in tandem with combinatorial metaanalysis. We explain the rationale of this idea, suggest descriptive and inferential statistical procedures, as well as graphical displays, provide code for meta-analytic practitioners to generate and use these, and present a fully worked real example from digit ratio (2D:4D) research, totaling 1,592 meta-analytic specifications. Specification-curve and multiverse meta-analysis holds promise to resolve conflicting metaanalyses, contested evidence, controversial empirical literatures, and polarized research, and to mitigate the associated detrimental effects of these phenomena on research progress.},

Between aspiring to achieve ideal worker status and enacting a style somewhere between the stereotypical connotations of agentic and communal behaviours, women leaders expended a great deal of emotional labour to find the perfect balance. Today, the COVID-19 pandemic has created a new, potentially untenable, challenge: to identify what working women are evaluated against to achieve excellence. This article shares a perspective of how women leaders have been evaluated during tumultuous times using historical research and examples.

In a systematic search of 13,136 potentially relevant studies published in the top HRM, international business (IB), general management (GM) and information management (IM) journals, we found 45 articles studying artificial intelligence, robotics and other advanced technologies within HRM settings. Results show that intelligent automation technologies constitute a new approach to managing employees and enhancing firm performance, thus offering several opportunities for HRM but also considerable challenges at a technological and ethical level. The impact of these technologies has been identified to concentrate on HRM strategies, namely, job replacement, human-robot/AI collaboration, decision-making and learning opportunities, and HRM activities, namely, recruiting, training and job performance. This study discusses these shifts in detail, along with the main contributions to theory and practice and directions for future research.},

We begin by exploring how crowdsourced tagging systems like those found on Goodreads have influenced the evolution of genre among readers and amateur critics, and we highlight the contemporary value of the “classics” in particu-lar. We identify the most commonly tagged “classic” literary works and find that Goodreads users have curated a vision of literature that is less diverse, in terms of the race and ethnicity of authors, than many U.S. high school and college syllabi. Drawing on computational methods such as topic modeling, we point to some of the forces that influence readers’ perceptions, such as schooling and what we call the classic industry — industries that benefit from the reinforcement of works as classics in other mediums and domains like film, television, publishing, and e-commerce (e.g., Goodreads and Amazon). We also high-light themes that users commonly discuss in their reviews (e.g., boring characters) and writing styles that often stand out in them (e.g., conversational and slangy language). Throughout the essay, we make the case that computational methods and internet data, when combined, can help literary critics capture the creative explosion of reader responses and critique algorithmic culture’s effects on literary history.},

At the heart of the debate on framing is the question of operationalizing and measuring emphasis frames. We harness novel computational tools to propose a new method for inductive identification of frames. We argue and demonstrate that frame elements could be identified using topic modeling, and that frame elements can then be automatically grouped into frame “packages” using community detection techniques applied to the topic network. Building upon recent conceptual and methodological developments in framing research, we introduce a new approach, the Analysis of Topic Model Networks (ANTMN). We demonstrate the applicability of our method in case studies where framing theory is developed and fairly consistent, and in exploratory ones where it is not, using three diverse U.S. news corpora: the coverage of political candidates in Senate races (n~=~8,337 articles), foreign nations (n~=~18,216), and infectious diseases and epidemics (n~=~5,005). We conclude by discussing the theoretical, methodological, and practical implications of ANTMN.},

This chapter suggests that selection theory should consider making fit assessments based on person–job fit, person–organization fit, and person–workgroup fit. Knowledge, skills, and abilities should be used to evaluate person–job fit. Values and needs should be used to assess person–organization fit. Interpersonal attributes and broad-based proficiencies should be used to assess person–workgroup fit. A facet model of selection decisions is developed that outlines the predictor and criterion variables in the selection process associated with each type of fit assessment. Predictor variables include work experience, educational experience, values, needs, broad-based proficiencies, and interpersonal attributes. Criterion measures include performance, motivation, extra-role behaviors, work attitudes, retention, group cooperation, and group performance. Research related to the predictor and criterion domains is examined. Propositions are developed to suggest when a type of fit assessment is most appropriate to use with different organizational conditions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Technological progress allows more and more functions once performed by humans to be automated. Theoretical conceptualizations in human-computer interaction (HCI) covered the evolution of computers from ‘tools’ to ‘partners’ in interaction with humans at work. However, nowadays computers have also begun to take over leadership functions, guiding and commanding human workers. We argue that conceptual coverage is in danger of falling short of this development and the implied profound change in hierarchy. To close this gap, we propose the paradigm of ‘computers as leaders’ and call for a scientific discourse of computers performing leadership functions. Building on research in HCI and human-human leadership, we suggest a definition of computer-human leadership and a respective structural model, entangling interaction roles of the different human and computer agents involved. Moreover, we discuss criteria for evaluating automated leadership systems and questions of function allocation, before we bring our propositions together in a theoretical model depicting how humans come to accept and follow a computer leader. Finally, we discuss implications of the proposed paradigm and call for awareness of ethical issues.},

This study examines how different portrayals of older characters relate to self-stereotyping, a process through which older individuals apply their beliefs about older people in general to themselves and behave accordingly. The study thereby seeks to connect, as few have previously done, cultural studies and critiques of media portrayals with psychological studies of the effects of self-stereotyping. Sixty participants aged 65–75 years were primed with television commercials that portrayed older characters in different ways: ‘warm and incompetent’, ‘warm and competent’, and ‘cold and competent’. It was hypothesised that priming with warm/incompetent portrayals would have a negative effect on memory performance because such representations match the dominant stereotype, and that the effect would occur only among older people who identify with their own age group. It was found that the participants who identified with their own age group did indeed show impaired memory performance after priming with warm/incompetent portrayals, but also that the same effect was found after priming with warm/competent portrayals. The findings are discussed in terms of resistance against stereotyping by older individuals themselves as well as by media producers.},

Interestingly, however, the dominant account for the behavioral effects of self-stereotype activation involves a hot motivational factor (i.e., stereotype threat), whereas the dominant account for the behavioral effects of other-stereotype activation focuses on a rather cold cognitive explanation (i.e., ideomotor processes). The current review compares and contrasts the behavioral research on self- and other-stereotype activation and concludes that both motivational and cognitive explanations might account for effects in each domain.},

In one social context, the material properties of the technology dominated, while in another the existing social context and relationships prevailed over the material properties of the technology.

The two errors are incorrect advice, triggering the automation bias, and missing advice, reflecting complacency.BackgroundContrasts between analogous automation errors in alerting systems, rather than decision aiding, have revealed that alerting false alarms are more problematic to HAI than alerting misses are. Prior research in decision aiding, although contrasting the two aiding errors (incorrect vs. missing), has confounded error expectancy.MethodParticipants performed an environmental process control simulation with and without decision aiding. For those with the aid, automation dependence was created through several trials of perfect aiding performance, and an unexpected automation error was then imposed in which automation was either gone (one group) or wrong (a second group). A control group received no automation support.ResultsThe correct aid supported faster and more accurate diagnosis and lower workload. The aid failure degraded all three variables, but ?automation wrong? had a much greater effect on accuracy, reflecting the automation bias, than did ?automation gone,? reflecting the impact of complacency. Some complacency was manifested for automation gone, by a longer latency and more modest reduction in accuracy.ConclusionsAutomation wrong, creating the automation bias, appears to be a more problematic form of automation error than automation gone, reflecting complacency.ImplicationsDecision-aiding automation should indicate its lower degree of confidence in uncertain environments to avoid the automation bias.},

  abstract = {In this fictionalized case, the protagonist is the director of talent and recruitment at Amazon and had been in charge of developing an artificial intelligence (AI) hiring tool that could shape the future of recruiting practices throughout the world. However, she begins to question the ethical implications of this tool. While the employees hired via this AI tool were performing exceptionally well, almost all of them were male, and she wonders how the tool she had helped create led to this result. There was no way to get around the fact that the hiring tool was gender biased, and the options are limited. The company could continue to use the tool as it currently existed, undoubtedly leading to a promotion for the protagonist. Or she could insist that Amazon invest more into the research and development of the AI tool, in hopes of creating an unbiased product. However, this option would be exorbitantly expensive in terms of both time and money and would reflect poorly on her efforts to produce this tool. A third option was for Amazon to scrap the AI hiring program altogether and return to traditional methods. The use of AI and automation was controversial, so perhaps showing the public that Amazon was putting people first would improve the company's image. The protagonist had to make a recommendation to senior management soon, and was uncertain what that should be. ExcerptUVA-E-0470Feb. 2, 2021Automated Hiring at AmazonIt was 2:00 p.m., and you were sitting at your desk preparing for the meeting that could make or break your career. In your six short months at Amazon as director of talent and recruitment, you had been in charge of developing an artificial intelligence (AI) hiring tool that could shape the future of recruiting practices throughout the world. The tool, which had been piloted at Amazon Crystal City for the past quarter, had the ability to process thousands of resumes in minutes and flag the most qualified candidates. You had a meeting with Chuck Mudd, your boss and director of human resources at Amazon Crystal City, at 3:00 p.m. to evaluate the tool's performance and discuss next steps. As an African-American businesswoman and graduate from the Wharton School of Business, you knew the importance of hard work to succeed, especially in a male-dominated sector. After a long and successful career as a business technology consultant at McKinsey \& Company, you had decided to shift career paths when you saw an opening for director of talent and recruitment at Amazon's second headquarters. Mudd had been especially impressed by your business-technology background and your ideas around automating Amazon's hiring process. Shortly after the start of your contract, Mudd gave you the green light to work alongside Arthur Mortimer, Amazon's AI director, to develop a tool to automate the rsum-review process. Mudd gave you free reign to determine the specifications of the bot, and proposed a one-quarter trial period for it. If it produced successful results, he promised a nice bonus and potential promotion. In developing the rsum-processing software, Mortimer fed the bot real resumes of tens of thousands of Amazon applicants, some of whom had been hired and some of whom had not. The bot learned the key qualities of the strongest rsums, such as the best universities, past position titles, and verbs associated with strong accomplishments.. . .},

  abstract = {We argue that in the Netherlands, due to the growth of part-time work, work norms have declined. The mechanism behind this norm change is in the changed organization of family life. The increased labour market participation of women has put the traditional organization of family life under pressure. Working mothers in the Netherlands opt for part-time jobs, thus sacrificing career opportunities for family life. Working fathers also have to trade-off hours, because a greater contribution to family life is expected from them. This implies that work norms are supported less by both women and men in their redefined roles than in their traditional roles. The hypotheses that follow from this argument are tested in multilevel regression analysis on the OSA Labour Supply Panel surveys for the period 1988–2002. The tests show that part-time working women and their partners adhere less to the work obligation norm than breadwinners and housewives. Adherence to the work obligation norm among parents has decreased with the growth of part-time work. Among non-parents, support for the norm has decreased too, but less than among parents. Our analyses show that, due to the growth of part-time work, the traditional division of labour is no longer predominant, and, as a result, the traditional work ethic is declining.},

Typically, such strategies assume that individuals are more likely to apply for a job when they possess the requirements needed for that job. However, how job seekers react to requirements in job ads is not often considered and is explored in the present study. In two experimental studies with Belgian university students we investigated whether person requirements about which women have negative meta-stereotypes (like the trait of emotionality) and the way such requirements are formulated in job ads (i.e., using trait-like adjectives, “You are calm/not nervous,” or behavior-like verbs, “You remain calm in stressful situations”) affected women’s job attraction and decision to apply. A repeated measures ANOVA showed that job attraction was lower if women held negative meta-stereotypes about required personality traits in job ads (Study 1; 218 women; Mage~=~23.44~years, range = 21–42; 97\% ethnic majorities). Moreover, qualified women applied to a lesser extent if a negatively meta-stereotyped trait was worded in a trait-like way than when it was worded in a behavior-like way (Study 2; n = 183; Mage~=~23.68~years, range = 21–44; 58\% women; 97\% ethnic majorities). A practical implication is that recruiters should be sensitive to how they formulate job ads if they wish to attract a highly qualified and gender-diverse applicant pool.},

Design/methodology/approach – Using the Occupational Personality Questionnaire and the Motivation Questionnaire, the study examined cross‐sectional differences in personality and motivational drivers across three generations. Findings – The results are not supportive of the generational stereotypes that have been pervasive in the management literature and the media. Specifically, few meaningful differences were found between the three generations. Moreover, even when differences have been observed, these have related more to age than generation. Research limitations/implications – One of the key limitations is the use of cross‐sectional data. To further explore this issue, it would be interesting to undertake a longitudinal study to assess personality preferences and motivational drivers of the different generations, when the participants are at the same age or the same point in their career. Practical implications – The research emphasizes the importance of managing individuals by focusing on individual differences rather than relying on generational stereotypes, which may not be as prevalent as the existing literature suggests. Originality/value – Managers and HR professionals may find the lack of differences across generations interesting and refreshing, in contrast with the popular management literature.},

The paper concludes that while employers’ recruitment practices are not the only cause of women's continued labour-market disadvantage – and are in themselves a function of the wider of economic, socio-cultural and ideological factors that underlie it (Kitching 2001; Patrickson 2001; Leung 2003; Cooke 2005) – a change to employer behaviour in this area is a necessary and potentially achievable step forward towards greater equality.},

  abstract = {Over the years, companies have adopted hiring algorithms because they promise wider job candidate pools, lower recruitment costs and less human bias. Despite these promises, they also bring perils. Using them can inflict unintentional harms on individual human rights. These include the five human rights to work, equality and nondiscrimination, privacy, free expression and free association. Despite the human rights harms of hiring algorithms, the AI ethics literature has predominantly focused on abstract ethical principles. This is problematic for two reasons. First, AI principles have been criticized for being vague and not actionable. Second, the use of vague ethical principles to discuss algorithmic risks does not provide any accountability. This lack of accountability creates an algorithmic accountability gap. Closing this gap is crucial because, without accountability, the use of hiring algorithms can lead to discrimination and unequal access to employment opportunities. This paper makes two contributions to the AI ethics literature. First, it frames the ethical risks of hiring algorithms using international human rights law as a universal standard for determining algorithmic accountability. Second, it evaluates four types of algorithmic impact assessments in terms of how effectively they address the five human rights of job applicants implicated in hiring algorithms. It determines which of the assessments can help companies audit their hiring algorithms and close the algorithmic accountability gap.},

We define audit firms whose auditors take professional training as non-violator firms and whose auditors do not take professional training as violator firms. Regression results indicate that financial performance of non-violator audit firms is better than that of violator firms. Male-owned audit firms are superior in financial performance to female-owned ones. Male-owned violator firms even outperform female-owned non-violator firms. In addition, the extent of financial performance effect of training in the female-owned audit firms is higher compared to the male-owned firms. Findings gained in this study indicate that gender-role stereotype dominates the determination of financial performance of Taiwanese audit firms due to the Chinese cultural values in social roles against women. This study extends prior studies on training and gender gap, contributing knowledge to the extant literatures.},

Findings from media effects studies suggest that stereotypical frames can activate the audiences' negative cognitive/affective responses. However, little effort has been made to bridge findings from these 2 approaches and explain the mechanism through which these activated responses further influence people's social interaction patterns. Recognizing the gap in the literature, this article proposes a cognitive-sociological model of stereotypical frames. The model explains the following relationship: (a) stereotypical frames can be classified into different genres according to their possible cognitive/affective effects; (b) responses activated by stereotypical frames are positively related to people's willingness to keep social distance in their minds; and (c) there is a negative relationship between social distance and the changing of people's stereotypical attitudes. Seven propositions that can guide future studies are also proposed.},

The under-representation of women, African-American and Latinx professionals in the IT workforce is a longstanding issue that contributes to and is impacted by algorithmic bias. Design/methodology/approach: Sources of algorithmic bias in talent acquisition software are presented. Feminist design thinking is presented as a theoretical lens for mitigating algorithmic bias. Findings: Data are just one tool for recruiters to use; human expertise is still necessary. Even well-intentioned algorithms are not neutral and should be audited for morally and legally unacceptable decisions. Feminist design thinking provides a theoretical framework for considering equity in the hiring decisions made by talent acquisition systems and their users. Social implications: This research implies that algorithms may serve to codify deep-seated biases, making IT work environments just as homogeneous as they are currently. If bias exists in talent acquisition software, the potential for propagating inequity and harm is far more significant and widespread due to the homogeneity of the specialists creating artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Originality/value: This work uses equity as a central concept for considering algorithmic bias in talent acquisition. Feminist design thinking provides a framework for fostering a richer understanding of what fairness means and evaluating how AI software might impact marginalized populations.},

  abstract = {Despite women’s uneven entrances into male-dominated occupations, limited scholarship has examined whether and how employers in different occupational classes unevenly discriminate against women during early hiring practices. This article argues that intersecting gendered and classed features of occupations simultaneously shape hiring-related practices and generate uneven patterns of inequality. Using data derived from comparative white-collar (N = 3,044 résumés) and working-class (N = 3,258 résumés) correspondence audits and content-coded analyses of more than 3,000 job advertisements, the author analyzes early hiring practices among employers across two gendered occupational dimensions: (1) sex composition (male- or female-dominated jobs) and (2) gender stereotyping (masculinized or feminized jobs, based on the attributes that employers emphasize in job advertisements). Broadly, findings suggest a polarization of early sorting mechanisms in which discrimination against female applicants is concentrated in male-dominated and masculinized working-class jobs, whereas discrimination against male applicants at early job-access points is more widespread, occurring in female-dominated and feminized jobs in both white-collar and working-class contexts. Interestingly, discrimination further compounds for male and female applicants—depending on the classed context—when these occupational dimensions align in the same gendered direction (e.g., male-dominated jobs that also have masculinized job advertisements). These findings have implications for the study of gender and work inequality and indicate the importance of a multidimensional approach to hiring-related inequality.},

The objective of this paper is to use representative survey data gathered among Dutch parents in April 2020 to explore differences between mothers and fathers in three areas: paid work, the division of childcare and household tasks, and three dimensions of quality of life (leisure, work-life balance, relationship dynamics). Additionally, we explore whether changes take place in these dimensions by comparing the situation prior to the lockdown with the situation during the lockdown.},

With material from 21 interviews with female chefs working in professional kitchens, we show, through the lens of constructing gender identities and meanings at the gender-body nexus, that three job crafting practices—negotiating physical competence, reframing creativity, and managing men co-workers reactions—are invented as creative responses to gender-related job demands. The findings contribute to the job crafting literature by showing that women's job crafting in male-dominated occupations is less about increasing or decreasing certain types of job demands, but more about enacting “dynamic displays”—material, discursive, and fluid—of their gender identities and meanings as situated responses to a given job demand being made. Our research indicates the importance of understanding the conditions under which job crafting is mostly likely to generate positive, negative, or mixed experiences over time.},

As stereotyping can influence attitudes and subsequent behaviors, pre-existing stereotypes of scientists as ‘cold’ may undermine trust in science and interest in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education. How, then, can scientists portray interpersonal warmth? Drawing on the stereotype content model’s warmth-competence literature, this study aimed to communicate scientists’ interpersonal warmth using the morality and emotional aspects of the warmth dimension in the context of a College of Agriculture and Natural Resources (CANR) as a test case of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) colleges. We used two, 3 (message type: control, prosocial, emotional-prosocial) × 2 (gender: women, men) between-subjects experimental design (n = 849) to examine the effect of message type and participant’s gender on perceptions of scientists’ interpersonal warmth. Results suggest that the combination of prosocial behaviors and emotional appeals were associated with perceived warmth of scientists. Furthermore, there was a significant interaction between message type and gender (Experiment 1) and a significant main effect of gender on perceived warmth (Experiment 2). These findings suggest further exploration of the morality and sociability aspects associated with warmth to reduce unflattering stereotypes of scientists.},

This study explores the public perceptions of algorithms used in resume and video interview screening. In addition, the effects of individual characteristics on these perceptions are examined. Using a nationally representative sample, we find that the public generally has a negative attitude towards the use of algorithms in hiring, and the majority do not consider them fair and effective. We also find clear individual differences regarding the perceptions towards algorithms. Specifically, males, people with higher education level and people with higher income have more positive perceptions towards hiring algorithms than their counterparts. The findings contribute to the emerging body of research on hiring algorithms and suggest strategies to increase public acceptance of hiring algorithms.},

We present Open Pre-trained Transformers (OPT), a suite of decoder-only pre-trained transformers ranging from 125M to 175B parameters, which we aim to fully and responsibly share with interested researchers. We show that OPT-175B is comparable to GPT-3, while requiring only 1/7th the carbon footprint to develop.

  abstract = {This study extends diffusion research to the intra-organizational level and integrates the classic diffusion of innovation theory (DIT) with the relatively new technology acceptance model (TAM) to empirically explore Chinese journalists' adoption of the internet. It makes a theoretical contribution by proposing four adoption categories — voluntary adopters, forced adopters, resistant non-adopters, and dormant non-adopters — according to the voluntariness of organizational members' innovation decision-making. Based on data from a nationwide survey of 813 journalists in China, this study demonstrates that the DIT and TAM are respectively related to voluntary and forced adoption of the internet.Young, male journalists who perceive the internet positively (i.e., relative advantage and ease of use) and think it to be popular in society are most likely to be voluntary adopters. High-ranking journalists who believe the internet can enhance their job performance and who work in large and technologically sophisticated organizations are most likely to be forced adopters.},

While many qualitative efforts have been made in related fields, it still lacks quantitative ways of measuring talent competencies as well as the job’s talent requirements. To this end, in this article, we propose a novel end-to-end data-driven model based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), namely, the Person-Job Fit Neural Network (PJFNN), for matching a talent qualification to the requirements of a job. To be specific, PJFNN is a bipartite neural network that can effectively learn the joint representation of Person-Job fitness from historical job applications. In particular, due to the design of a hierarchical representation structure, PJFNN can not only estimate whether a candidate fits a job but also identify which specific requirement items in the job posting are satisfied by the candidate by measuring the distances between corresponding latent representations. Finally, the extensive experiments on a large-scale real-world dataset clearly validate the performance of PJFNN in terms of Person-Job Fit prediction. Also, we provide effective data visualization to show some job and talent benchmark insights obtained by PJFNN.},

  abstract = {For many job seekers, organizational affiliation can act as a signal of their values and goals. According to theory of symbolic attraction (TSA), job seekers are attracted to organizations with symbolic images (i.e., organizational personality) that help them portray a certain type of social identity. However, studies have found mixed support for TSA and this may be attributed to a lack of a broad and theoretically-based taxonomy of organizational personality. As such, we drew on multiple theoretical perspectives from the social judgment literature to develop an alternative two-factor organizational personality taxonomy. Across three studies, we first created and validated a scale to reliably and validly measure organizational personality. Then, we showed that active job seekers with different social identity needs are indeed attracted to companies that differ along the two dimensions of the new taxonomy (i.e., warmth and competence) using LinkedIn job advertisements. Finally, we used computer-aided text analysis (CATA) to index organizational personality from company mission statements but found only partial support for TSA in a sample of engineering job seekers. We contribute to the recruitment literature by exploring why certain job seekers are initially attracted to different types of organizations and discuss how TSA can be further developed and refined. Practically, our results highlight the potential utility of organizations signaling images that resonate with job seekers' social identity concerns early on in the recruitment process.},
