# Bias in Candidate Sourcing Communication:
## Investigating Stereotypical Gender- And Age-Related Frames in Online Job Advertisements at the Sectoral Level

### Abstract:

Studies show the extent to which job advertisements contain stereotypical wordings correlates with the level of segregation at individual job level and boarder occupation level. However, limited research links the framing of job ads to gender- and age-based segregation at the sector level. Guided by the stereotype content model, we operationalize stereotypical warmth and competence-related frames in candidate sourcing communication and investigate their presence in job ads from occupational sectors with varying levels of segregation. Automated content analysis was conducted on a dataset of online job ad sentences (*n*=307154). Results indicate warmth-related frames are most observed in ads from female-dominated (vs. male-dominated) and younger-dominated (vs. older-dominated and mixed-age) dominated sectors. Conversely, competence-related frames are most observed in ads from male-dominated (vs. female-dominated and mixed-gender) and older-dominated (vs. younger-dominated and mixed-age) sectors. Taken together, we present an operationalization of stereotypical warmth- and competence-related frames in early employer communication and posit that social categorization framing may be at play.
