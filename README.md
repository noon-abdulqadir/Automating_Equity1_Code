### Bias in Candidate Sourcing Communication:
#### Investigating Stereotypical Gender- And Age-Related Frames in Online Job Advertisements at the Sectoral Level

#### Abstract:

Studies show that the extent to which job advertisements contain stereotypical wordings correlates with the level of segregation in an occupational domain however, limited research link the framing of job advertisements to social category-based segregation at the occupational sectoral level. Guided by the stereotype content model, the present study operationalizes stereotypical social categorization frames in candidate sourcing communication and investigates their presence in job advertisements from occupational sectors with varying gender and age segregation. We conduct an automated (supervised) content analysis on a dataset of online job advertisements (n=17,087). Results indicate warmth-related frames are most observed in advertisements from female-dominated (vs. male-dominated and mixed-gender) sectors. Conversely, competence-related frames are most observed in advertisements from male-dominated (vs. female-dominated) and younger worker-dominated (vs. older worker-dominated and mixed-age) sectors. Taken together, we present an operationalization of stereotypical warmth- and competence-related frames in early employer communication and posit that social categorization framing may be at play.
